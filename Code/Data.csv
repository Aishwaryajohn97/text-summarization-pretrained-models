Breaking Peace,"RICHARD BOWERS . I live at 1, Chadwick Street, Westminster—I was in Monk Street on December 19th, about 1 a.m.; my wife and brother-in-law were coming up behind me—I saw the prisoner there—he said, ""There is one of the b——s""—I saw him nearly every day—I had not had any words with him on that night, but he had insulted me and my wife before—he was standing on some lodging-house steps—I walked on, and he came up and said, ""Did you mean that for me?"" and knocked me down—I jumped up and hit him—a gentleman came up and said to me, ""Go away, my good man; he has got a knife in his hand""—I then found I had a cut on my head, and when we got home my wife found a bad cut on my throat—I went to the hospital, and it was stitched up.

JOSEPH SANGER . I live at 45, Romney Street, Westminster, and am a coachman—I was with Bowers on December 19th, in Monk Street, Westminster—he is my brother-in-law—I saw the prisoner—he had an up and tumble fight with my brother-in-law—they fell down, and the prisoner got up and dragged my brother-in-law up against some factory gates—I saw something in the prisoner's hand, but cannot say the colour of the handle of the knife—I gave the prisoner into custody—I charged him in the lodging-house with stabbing my brother-in-law—he never said anything—

there were two constables there—he said that I should have to go through with it.

JOHN ASHMAN (382A). In consequence of a complaint on the early morning of December 19th, I went to a lodging-house in Monk Street—I saw the prisoner there in bed—Sanger was with me—he said in the prisoner's presence, ""This is the man who stabbed my brother-in-law""—the prisoner said, ""No, I had a fight with the man, but I did not stab him. I was standing at the lodging-house in Monk Street, when I was struck by a man. I got up, and I fought the man""—I have not got a note of the conversation—he said it was an old grievance, and that he had no knife.

GUY COLTART . I am house surgeon at Westminster Hospital—I made an examination of the prosecutor on the early morning of December 19th—I found two clean cut wounds on the side of his head and one punctured wound on the.side of his neck about 1 in. long and 1 in. deep in a slanting direction—I stitched up the wound in his neck and one of the wounds in his head, the other was merely a scratch—he got quite well in about a week—the wounds were probably caused by some sharp instrument; the one on his head might have been caused by his falling or being thrown against a wall; one of them must have been caused by a sharp instrument—no permanent injury has been caused—he was sober.

By the COURT. The wound in the neck was in a pretty dangerous position, but it was not dangerous.

The prisoner, in his defence, said that as he was going home down Monk Street the prosecutor came up and said he would knock his eye out; that he (the prisoner) struck him back, and then they had a fight for about 15 minutes.

GUILTY .

He then Pleaded Guilty to a conviction at this Court, on November 13th, 1893, of cutting and wounding, when he was sentenced to Twelve Months— Three Years' Penal Servitude."
Theft,"WILLIAM JOHN WHYTE . On December 13th, between 12 and 1, I was looking into a window in Cheapside; there was a good crowd there—my attention was drawn by a gentleman on my left, and I looked at the prisoner, who was on my right, with my watch clasped in his hand—I caught him by his throat and gave him in custody—he said, ""I have not done anything yet""—I held him and gave him in custody.

Cross-examined. There were about 15 people there—the gentleman went away.

PERCY VALE (Policeman). I am now under orders for South Africa—on December 13th Mr. Whyte gave the prisoner into my custody for attempting to steal a gold watch and chain—he made no reply—I found on him this six-chambered revolver—I asked him if he had a licence—he said, ""No; the man at the shop where I bought it would not give me a licence.""

The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate: ""I do not know anything about it. I will say something at the trial.""

GUILTY . Five previous convictions were proved against him. Twenty Months' Hard Labour."
Theft,"JAMES AMOS (City Detective). On January 1st, at 1.30,1 was in Fenchurch Street, and saw the prisoner carrying this coat on his arm—I asked him where he got it—he said, ""I had it given me by a friend to sell""—he was wearing these gloves—I took him to the station and found in his pocket a letter in the name of Edith Young, and traced the owner of the property.

WALTER DAVIS . I am manager of the Woolpack public-house, City, about a quarter of an hour's walk from Fenchurch Street—this coat and gloves are mine; I missed them on the afternoon of the 29th, and my barmaid's jacket and handbag—this letter is addressed to her (Miss Young) and it was in the handbag when it was stolen—I can identify the bag—the prisoner was arrested on January 1st—Sunday had intervened.

The prisoner, in his statement before the Magistrate, and in his defence, said that he got his living by buying and selling things, and gave 3s. for the coat and 6d. for the bag.— GUILTY of receiving. He then Pleaded Guilty to a conviction at Clerkenwell on January 1st, 1897, nd twelve other convictions were proved against him.— Three Years' Penal Servitude."
Killing,"about 4.30 p.m. on August 30th I was driving my van along the Caledonian Road in the direction of Albion Street—outside a public-house there I saw four men in deep conversation—I saw an old gentleman walking along the road—the four men followed him down—my van got close up to the old gentleman, and I saw Barrett (See Sessions Paper, Vol. CXXX., page 923) separate from the others—he ran behind my van, then ran across the road in front of it, and came in front of the old gentleman—Grande made a signal with his left arm for Barrett to do something to the old gentleman—Barrett made a snatch at the old gentleman's chain, and hit him under the chin with his other hand; then the other three rushed upon him and hustled him, and threw him down, with his legs in the gutter and his head on the pavement—I shouted out, ""Oh, you brutes!"" and jumped off my van—one of the men said to the deceased, ""Mind where you are going to""—then they all four ran round a public-house on the other side—I picked the old gentleman up—he had a wound on the back of his head—I tied my handkerchief round his head, and called for assistance—part of his watch-chain was in his pocket, and part not—I picked Thompson out at the Police-court, but at the Police-station I failed to identify him—I was examined here last October, when the other men, Barrett, Grande, and Jones, were tried, and convicted—I say now that the prisoner is the fourth man.

By the COURT. Barrett was the man who hit the old gentleman under the chin—as he fell back he fell on the other three, and they knocked him into the gutter.

Cross-examined by the Prisoner. I did not hear you speak to Grande.

GEORGE FREDERICK BARNES . I am a railway porter—on the afternoon of Wednesday, October 30th, I was walking down Caledonian Street in the direction of Albion Street—I saw the old gentleman and four men round him hustling and struggling with him—one of them struck his arm as if to make a snatch, and he fell on the back of his head in the gutter—three of the men ran away, one stopped a second or two as if to pick him up, then he ran after Jones or Bliss, as he is called—I identified three of the men, and the fourth is the prisoner.

GEORGE JARED . I was next to the Albion public-house in Albion Street, Caledonian Road, on August 30th, in the afternoon—I saw three men running away; I followed them as fast as I could, but they got away—I heard Barrett say, ""It is no good running now ""—the third man who was running was the prisoner—some time after December 10th I was taken to the Police-station, and amongst them I saw the third man who was running away; that was Thompson.

By the COURT. I saw the old gentleman on the ground with his head in the gutter.

JAMES HARVEY . I am a house agent—I knew Mr. Benbow—on August 30th, about 3.30 p.m., I was called to see him in Albion Street—he was about 64 years old—he was bleeding; I got a cab and took him to the hospital—his chain was missing, his watch was there—he had a £2 piece, which was gone.

THOMAS WALTER COFFIN, F.R.C.S . I practise at 31, Maiden Terrace, Haverstock Hill—I was the regular medical attendant of Mr. Benbow—he enjoyed pretty good health, and was a fairly strong man—I saw him

a short time before August 30th; he was then in fairly good health—I was called on the evening of August 30th to his house, and I found him suffering from a very severe injury go his brain—I did all I could for him; he lingered on till the early morning of October 1st, when he died—I made a post-mortem examination and found that the cause of death was a compound comminuted fracture of the skull, and extensive fractures to the base of the skull—those would quite naturally result from the deceased having been pushed down on to a kerbstone and coming in contact with the stone—I have no doubt that it was from those injuries that he died.

THOMAS PERCY LEGG . I was the house surgeon at the Royal Free Hospital on August 30th, when I attended to and dressed Mr. Benbow's wounds—he had an injury to the base of the skull, from which he was bleeding freely—he desired to go away and have his own doctor—he left and went under the care of Dr. Coffin—all that I saw was consistent with what Dr. Coffin has said.

GEORGE GODLEY (Detective Officer). About 2.45 p.m. on December 10th I saw the prisoner in the Edinboro' Castle public-house—I said, ""I want you to come outside""—I took him out and said, ""I am Sergeant Godley""—he said, ""Yes, I know you; I knew it would come sooner or later""—I said, ""I shall arrest you for the manslaughter of Henry Benbow in Albion Street on August 80th last, and being concerned with Grande, Barrett, and Bliss""—he said, ""Bliss did not ought to have got so much as he did; I am sorry for my old woman; it was Grande who knocked him out, and Barrett pulled his lot""—I took him to the station, but the witness who attended could not identify him—in the dock at the Court two witnesses identified him, and he was placed with four men, and was identified by Jared—I searched him on his arrest and found two knives, one was a dagger knife.

WALTER SELBY (Detective, G). I was present at the arrest of the prisoner on December 10th, and on the 11th when he was put up for identification by Button and Barnes in the library of the station—I took him back to the cells after—on the way to the cells he said, ""What is the good of messing about like this? I am identified""—he had not been identified then—later on he was placed in the dock of the station and formally charged, after which he called me and said, ""Selby, those two men did not identify me from amongst the others, but if the carman likes to speak the truth he knows I did not touch the old man, and must have heard Grande say he would knock him out, and must have heard me say, ""For God's sake don't do so; I never go in for knocking anybody about.""

The Prisoner, in his defence, said that he met the others in a public-house, and was going up the road with them when one of them said, ""Here is our fellow,"" and then he (the prisoner) said, ""What are you going to do?"" that they said, ""Knock this fellow out if he says anything""; that he said, ""For God's sake don't do that""; that they started running, and that he did the same because he thought people would think he had helped them, and that he did not stop running till he got home.

GUILTY .— Fifteen Months' Hard Labour.

The✗ COURT awarded £5 to Button."
Deception,"GEORGE ENGLISH BOYLE . I am a messenger at the Record Office at the London Bankruptcy Court, and produce the file of proceedings in the bankruptcy of Alfred Lusson—the petition was presented on March 17th, 1896—the order of adjudication is dated June 10th, 1896—the liabilities were shown to be £140 10s. 4d., assets nil—he has never applied for his discharge, and is at present an undischarged bankrupt.

Cross-examined. There is a report by the Official Receiver that there is a sufficient sum in hand to pay 20s. in the £—the total amount is £288 8s. 4d.

HENRY OTT . I live at Fairhome, Bushey Hill Road, Camberwell, and am clerk to Messrs. Windover, Turril & Son, of Long Acre, the petitioning creditors in the bankruptcy of Alfred Lusson in 1896—the prisoner is the man.

JAMES STRATTON THOMPSON . On December 15th I traded with a partner, now I trade by myself as Thompson & Co., at 7, Copthall Court—a Mr. Albert Golden has a desk in my office—on December 15th he came to me and instructed me to buy 50 Lake View Consols for Alfred Lusson; the amount given was £796 17s. 6d.—there was a commission of £6 58., and the stamps and charges were £4 3s. 6d.—a contract note was sent to the prisoner the same evening—next day I had instructions from Mr. Golden to sell 100 shares—I declined to sell more than 50—I sold 50 at 1411-16ths, which came to £734 6s. 6d., leaving a balance of £68 17s.—I sent him a contract note the same evening—I never got an answer to that—there was, I think, a letter sent on December 29th, another on December 22nd, and a telegram on June 2nd—I have never been paid to this day—I went to my solicitors, and discovered that the prisoner was an undischarged bankrupt—I did not know that till December 22nd.

Cross-examined. I was responsible for what I bought—Mr. Goldon brought me the orders, and I carried out the transactions.

ALBERT GOLDEN I am a commission agent, and have a seat in the office of Messrs. Thompson & Co. 7, Copthall Court—I first met

the accused in 1891—I was introduced to him again by a Mr. Daniel Boyd on December 12th last, and on December 15th he gave me instructions to buy some shares for him—I passed on the order to Mr. Thompson—the shares were purchased, and on December 16 th I got a letter from the accused, begging me to sell 100 of the same shares, and Mr. Thompson sold 50—I know that two letters were sent to him, and I called at the Hotel Metropole to ask him to pay the difference—I first learned that he was an undischarged bankrupt on December 22nd.

Cross-examined. I dined with the prisoner and his wife at the Hotel Metropole on either the night before or the night after my transaction with him—I think it was the night before, but I should not like to take my oath on it—I have not seen him constantly since 1891; only on a few occasions—I do not know what nationality he is; he calls himself Baron de Lussan—when I first knew him he called himself Alfred Baker—I did not know that the Alfred Baker whom I knew in 1891 had become bankrupt—I had not seen him for eight or nine years prior to December 22nd—no business matters were discussed at the dinner at the Metropole—I did not advise him to enter into this transaction—his wife did not say he could not, because he was an undischarged bankrupt—Mr. Boyd was a customer of Mr. Thompson's—the last time I saw the prisoner prior to the day when I had dinner with him was the Tuesday in the same week—I thought I knew him then as the person I had known in 1891 as Baker, and I told him so—from 1892 to 1899 I never clapped eyes on him, either in or out of the City—I did not make inquiries about him at Stubbs's, but on December 15th, when he had given the order, Messrs. Thompson wrote to Messrs. Stubbs—I did not tell the prisoner that the transaction was an excellent speculation, because Ladysmith had been relieved—he might have spoken on the war topic—I did not advise him at all.

Re-examined. When I was introduced to Baron de Lussan I was given this card—(Read: ""Baron de Lussan, Woodcroft Castle, Market Deeping, Northampton shire"")—on December 12th I went with another gentleman to the Hotel Metropole by appointment to meet Mr. Daniel Boyd and the defendant at 9 p.m.—on arrival there Mr. Boyd introduced the Baron de Lussan to the other gentleman, and he then turned round and said, ""I need not introduce you to Mr. Golden, as he says he has met you before""—the prisoner looked surprised—I said, ""I think I met you some eight or nine years ago in a wine merchant's office; is not your name Baker?""—he said ""No""—I apologised, and he handed me his card—on going down to the smoking-room I said to Boyd, ""I fear I have made a mistake""—the prisoner said, ""Yes, he has taken me for a half-brother by the same mother by a different father: that individual has already cost me, £1,500 by mistakes""—I had not the slightest reason or ground for suspecting that he was an undischarged bankrupt—I know that Mr. Thompson sent for particulars to Stubbs, which arrived on December 22nd.

By the COURT. I did not know that Baker had been bankrupt.

The prisoner, in his defence, on oath, said that Mr. Golden knew perfectly well that he was an undischarged bankrupt, and had asked him (the prisoner) if he had applied for his discharge; and that Golden had advised

him to invest in some shares when dining at the Metropole; he admitted that he had been made bankrupt three times.

MR. ALBERT GOLDEN (Re-examined). I never had a conversation (with the prisoner) on a street refuge outside the Royal Exchange on the subject of his bankruptcy.

Evidence for the Defence.

EMMA ELIZABETH LUSSON . I am the prisoner's wife—I was present at the dinner at the Metropole on December 14th—Mr. Golden said that he had seen a telegram from the War Office at the Stock Exchange, saying that Ladysmith had been relieved, and that it was a good time to do business—I said I objected to my husband speculating, as his means did not allow of it—Mr. Golden said, ""It is simply a flutter, and will be all right; I know your husband; I have met him before""—I said, ""How long have you known my husband?""—he said, ""I should be sorry to say how long""—I had never met him before.

Cross-examined. I was married on March 11th, 1896.

GUILTY — Three Months' Hard Labour."
Royal Offences,"JOSEPH DEMPSEY . I keep the Old Duncan public-house, Soho—I was in the bar last Wednesday—the prisoner came in and tendered this 5s. piece for a glass of beer, which came to 1d.—I found it was bad—here are my teeth marks on it—I asked him where he got it; he said from his employer—I asked him where his employer was—he said, ""I don't know""—I said, ""Where does he live?""—he gave me no answer—I tried to break the coin, but it was too hard—I gave it back to him, and said, ""Mark my words, if you take the change for that you are liable to be prosecuted""—I saw him next morning among several others, and picked him out at once—I have no doubt that he is the man.

BEATRICE SHOFORD . I am 13 years old, and am the daughter of the landlord of the, Admiral Dunn, only a few steps from the Old Duncan—on January 24th the prisoner called for a glass of ginger

beer, price 1d.—he gave me a 5s. piece, and I gave him 4s. 11d. change—I had seen him before more than once—I took the coin to my father—I saw the prisoner next morning at Marlborough Street Station with others, and at once identified him.

CHARLES SHOFORD . I keep the Crown—the last witness is my daughter—I know the prisoner as using my house—on January 24th I saw my daughter serve him—he drank the ginger beer in a hurry—my daughter gave me this crown piece—I saw it was a wrong one, and I went outside, but did not see the prisoner—I informed the police, and about two hours afterwards I went into the Round House with a constable, saw the prisoner and said, ""That is the man""—he said at the Police-station that he had not been into my house at all.

GEORGE WESTON (Policeman, T). I was sent for to the Round House public-house, saw the prisoner, and said, ""I shall take you in custody for passing a bad crown piece""—be said, ""It is all false; I have not been in the house to-night""—he was charged, and made no reply.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER . I am Inspector of coin to Her Majesty's Mint—this crown is counterfeit.

The prisoner, in his statement before the Magistrate, and in his defence, stated that he was drunk, and knew nothing about it, or about Mr. Dempsey cautioning him.

GUILTY .— He had been convicted in August, 1898, of stealing a watch from the person.—Eighteen Months' Hard Labour."
Deception,"HENRY RICHARD RASHLEIGH . I am manager to Robert Masters, a turf commission agent, of Guernsey, who trades under the name of Spot Guernsey—we accept bets provided the telegram is handed in a quarter of an hour before the set time of the race—I received this letter (Produced) in January from Arthur Thompson, 325a, King's Road, Chelsea—(This stated: ""I desire to open an account with you; please send terms."")—I subsequently received a deposit of £5 in the same name to open an account for bets to be made by telegram—on January 15th I received this telegram; ""Regent Street, 12.57. Received here, Guernsey, 1.32, Spot Guernsey, Narrow Oakum, Jailbird, Art""—he wrote another letter, which I have not got, explaining the telegram—I read that, ""£2 to win on Jailbird""—our total loss was £2 6s. 8d.—there was another transaction on which we lost £4—I sent him the balance, £9, by money order payable to Arthur Thompson, deducting commission—this is the order (Produced); it is signed ""Arthur Thompson""—on February 14th we received another telegram from the same person, ""Sarah Narrow Oakum, Art,"" that means ""£2 on Oakum to win""—there were a few other bets, and I sent a cheque for £9 14s., the balance of all the transactions up to that date—on March 4th I received this letter front Arthur Thompson, dated the 2nd; ""Sir,—Owing to unforeseen circumstances I shall not be able to continue my account with you, and when I wish to re-commence I will write to you""—I replied to that—I never saw Arthur Thompson; it was all done by letter and telegram—this letter (Dated March 2nd) is written to us by Arthur Thompson, and represents the various transactions between us—£2 was the amount he usually put on the winning horse.

Cross-examined. Besides these about 15 other wires were sent to us; I believe they were genuine—out of those 15 there were 12 losses, amounting to £24 18s.

Re-examined. This is our account—there is a win of £35, and a loss of £12 18s.—this is a copy of the ledger from the beginning—they won about £10.

EMILY ATWOOD ANDREWS . I am a telegraphist in the Central Telegraph Office, St. Martin's-le-Grand—on January 15th, at 1.31 (Exhibit 17) was put down by my desk for transmission to Guernsey, and from that I sent the message; it bears my signature—it reached Guernsey at 1.32.

FRANK HENRY CLAXTON . I am a telegraphist in the Central Office—on January 15th I was in the room devoted to racing news from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.—I received a wire from Manchester Grand Stand at 1.24, showing that Jailbird had won the race there—the message was not to be delivered to the public, which means that it goes over another wire.

FREDERICK PERCIVAL . I am a telegraphist in the Central Office—on January 15th I was in the G Division, the Eastern Counties, which includes the wires from Newmarket, and Shapley asked me to change

with him, as it was easier duty; it was 4 p.m. to 11.45—he took my place from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., so that he was in the room when the telegrams from Newmarket arrived.

By MR. STEPHENSON (For Shapley). I am not one of the seniors; I am about the 19th—I am a good deal older than Shapley—I did not know that he was doing a little bit—I have not paid a bet for him or for myself—one official often asks another to take his duty.

LOUISA ANN SIMES . I am a telegraphist in the Central Office; not St. Martin's—on February 4th I sent the message contained in Exhibit 14, which purports to have been handed in at Regent Street at 2.20—this is a copy of it (Produced).

THOMAS COAD ANTONY . On February 4th I received this message on Exhibit 22 from Manchester Grand Stand at 2.42—it shows that a horse named Sarah had won the race.

THOMAS LEWELLYN REES . I am a telegraphist in the Central Office—on February 4th I was on duty with Shapley—his hours were 12 to 8, and mine 9 to 6, and we obliged one another—he asked me to change places with him, and gave me a shilling for doing so—he undertook my duty in the racing-room that day—a telegram coming from Nottingham at 11.42 would come under my notice.

Cross-examined by MR. STEPHENSON. There is no fixed rate of payment.

WALTER HARRY PETERS . I am assistant superintendent of the Central Office—on January 4th I was on duty in the racing-room, and saw Shapley there—he had every opportunity of seeing the results of the races as they arrived—he would have no difficulty in setting in circulation a telegraphic message, by placing it on the table just as if it was a genuine message.

CHARLES CHUCK . I am manager to Mr. Arthur Magnus, a commission agent, of 67, Stanley Street, Liverpool—his telegraphic address is ""Magnus, Liverpool""—our condition as to telegraphic bets is up to £5 up to the time the race is to be run—I received from Arthur Thompson, 325A, King's Road, Chelsea, a deposit of £10—he could send any sum he pleased—he assumed the name of Tar—this telegram, No. 3, reads, ""Perch, Edwardine, Tar""—that means ""Put me £5 on Edwardine to win""—No. 5 is ""Perch, Chirpy, Tar,"" and No. 6 is ""Perch, Hobnob, Tar""—those were horses running in the 2 o'clock race—telegram No. 3 is signed 2.35, and I should receive it about 10 minutes afterwards—Edwardine won on February 22nd, which resulted in a loss of £30—the telegram would take half an hour to get from Regent Street to Liverpool—I sent £25 in notes, and two sovereigns, and a postal order in a registered letter—he had lost £2 on a previous bet—Chirpy won on February 27th, which was a loss of £25 to us—I thought there was a mistake, as 48 minutes was a long time in comparison with a telegram which we had before, and I requested that the time should be repeated—I wrote to Thompson the same night, and have a copy here—(Dated February 27th, declining to execute farther commissions pending inquiry.)—I got another telegram on the 28th for Model, and wired to Thompson that no commissions would be executed for him—I got no reply—it takes a few days to get the answers—I wrote again on March 1st, ""I wrote you last evening no further commissions would be executed for you; nothing was done for you""—I received

no reply—there is more than £10 in our hands, and we have had no claim for it—the telegram of the 28th means, ""Put me £5 on Hobnob to win""—Hobnob had won, and we should have lost £50.

Cross-examined. Two other genuine telegrams were sent to us, but they were at least half an hour before the race—we won on both—I have not got the Model telegram—Prince Hampton was a first favourite—it is not unusual to race in another name to one's own.

CHARLES HENRY SALMON . I am a telegraphist in the Central Office—on February 22nd I was on duty at one of the Liverpool wires, and received Exhibit 4 for transmission to Liverpool—I dispatched it at 2.25—Exhibit 3 is the form in which the message would be delivered; it is only five words—it was received within a minute.

CHARLES JAMES LEAT . I am a telegraphist at the Central Office—on February 22nd I was on duty in the racing-room, receiving messages and the names of the winners—at 2.10 I got Exhibit 10, which shows that Edwardine won a race at Birmingham.

GEORGE ADAMS . I am one of the assistant superintendents in the Racing Division of the Central Telegraph Office—I was on duty on February 22nd—Shapley was there from 2.20 to 4 p.m. collecting messages for the wires—he would know the result immediately it was received in London, and if he wrote it on one of these forms and put it on the table, the clerk would send it on.

Cross-examined. A number of persons were performing the same duty—Mr. Percival was not working on the same date—there is considerable temptation to dishonesty in the way of persons there if they have dishonest intentions.

WILLIAM CHARLES HOOPER . I am a telegraphist in the Central Office—Exhibit 8 has my mark on it; it was put on the instrument by the distributor, and I sent it to Liverpool at 2.40 p.m. by the direct wire.

GEORGE THOMAS HUTCHINSON . I am a telegraphist in the Central Department—I was on duty on March 1st—Exhibit 9 was put on my desk, and I transmitted it to Liverpool at 2.30.

SIDNEY HIMES . I am a telegraphist in the Central Department—on February 2 th I received Exhibit 11 at 2.20—the name of the horse was Chirpy—the telegram came from Warwick Grand Stand—it would be distributed all round.

RICHARD COOK . I am assistant superintendent of the G Division of the Central Department—I was on duty on February 27th and March 1st—Shapley was on duty on both those days, in a position to learn the result of winners within a few moments of the race—No. 8 is a telegram purporting to have been sent off at 2.42—Shapley was in a position to put that in circulation at that time—No. 9 was in circulation for Liverpool in the same way; the time on that is 2.26.

GEORGINA SOPHIA LYNCH . I am assistant superintendent of the B group in the Metropolitan Gallery, Central Telegraph Office—I was on duty there on February 22nd and 27th and March 1st—these forms, 4, 8 and 9, purport to come from the Regent Street office—we have 10 wires communicating with Regent Street—they have the names of three operatives—the wires 829 and 830 were not at work that day in

an upward direction; telegrams were transmitted, but not to Regent Street—neither of the three telegraphists whose names are on these forms was at work on those days, and between those hours no telegrams were received from Regent Street on those wires.

ARTHUR BECKS . I am a tobacconist, of 325A, King's Road, Chelsea—part of my business is to receive letters for customers, addressed to my place for 1d. each—Baker came there in January and asked if I would take in letters for him in the name of Arthur Thompson—I agreed; letters came, he called for them, and I gave them to him—they were all from Guernsey or Liverpool—on February 12th he brought me this cheque for £9 14s., and asked if I could oblige him by cashing it, but I could not—on February 23rd a registered letter came for him—he called for it, and had it early in the morning—on February 28th a letter came by the first post with the Liverpool post-mark, and just after 3 p.m. a telegram—next morning there was another letter from Liverpool by the first post—Baker had them on March 2nd; he also had the letters named in Exhibit 1—on March 7th, about 3 p.m., while those letters were still in my possession, Shapley called—I had not seen him before—he gave no name—he asked if there were any letters for Arthur Thompson, as he was away at Portsmouth Arsenal, and he had had a letter asking him to call for them—I told him I could not let him have them—I still had them on March 14th, when Baker called about 6 p.m., when an official from the Past-Office was waiting in a room at the back—I had made an arrangement with him, and knocked at the glass when Baker was on the door mat—he seemed very agitated; he walked in and out, but would not come to the counter at all, and when I handed him the letters he ran out without them—the door was open—Tower, the Post Office constable, brought him back—he did not say why he ran away—I then gave him the letters—half of the shop is in Beaufort Street; it is on the corner.

WILLIAM MARTIN . I am in the Naval Store Department of the Admiralty—Baker was a copyist in that department from June, 1897, to August, 1899, when he was appointed second-class writer at Portsmouth—he was lent to the Admiralty, for convenience, from March 2nd to 14th—his hours were from 10 to 5, and sometimes from 9.30—he had an interval in the middle of the day—I know his writing—I believe this postal order and cheque to be his writing—he was paid 24s. a week, and had an allowance of 23s. 4d. for being in London.

Cross-examined. I have known him since he entered in 1897—he was a very good boy at his work, and received steady promotion on account of his good behaviour—he has been a straightforward lad, as far as I know.

FREDERICK HERBERT SWEET . I live at 47, Beaufort Street, Chelsea—Baker lodged with me for about four years, till about three weeks before he was arrested—I had no idea where he went from my house till after his arrest—Sidney Street is about seven minutes' walk off—he wished me good-bye when he left, because he was going to another appointment—he boarded with me—he was away at Portsmouth last year—Shapley is my brother-in-law—he often came to my house when Baker was there—his father is a very respectable man, living in the neighbourhood.

Cross-examined. Baker came from Dublin—he is of a respectable

family, and was then employed as a boy clerk at South Kensington Museum, and subsequently he got into the Admiralty—both the prisoners were members of St. Peter's Club.

By the COURT. I was under the impression that he had gone to another appointment—I believe he said something to my wife, but he only went away for a few weeks.

ALBERT BONE . I am a draper, of 90, Fulham Road—someone from Mr. Shapley's brought me this cheque for £9 14s.—I do not know whether Shapley had a banking account—I frequently changed cheques for him—it has my signature on the back.

MATTHEW TOWER . I am a police officer attached to the Poet Office—on March 14th, about 6.30 p.m., I was at Mr. Becks' premises—an intimation was made to me; I came out of the shop, and saw Baker 25 or 30 yards away, just dropping from a very hasty step into a leisurely one, looking anxiously over his shoulder, and going towards his lodging—I went up to him and said, ""I am a police officer; it is necessary for you to come to the Post Office""—he made no reply—I took him back to the shop, and saw Mr. Becks hand him two letters—I took him to the General Post Office—Mr. Wood saw him, and he was given into custody about 9 o'clock—I searched him, and found on him this £5 Bank of England note—(Mr. Chuck here identified the number of the note.)—I took Baker to Old Scotland Yard, and charged him—he made no reply—next day I searched Shapley's lodgings—his father is a butcher there—when Shapley was searched I said, ""What keys have you?""—he gave me some keys, and said that £2 would be found there—I went there, and found £7 in gold.

Cross-examined. He went with me without any objection whatever.

FRANK ORSON WOOD . I am in the Confidential Department of the General Post Office—in consequence of a complaint from Liverpool I was requested to make special inquiry into this case—I instructed Tower to bring Baker to the Post Office, and produced to him Exhibit No. 5, of February 27th, and said, ""This telegram was received by Mr. Magnum, of Liverpool, from Arthur Thompson, purporting to be handed in at the Regent Street Office, but that it was not handed in there""—he said that he would answer any questions I liked to put—I asked him who he was—he said his name was Baker, of 47, Beaufort Street—I showed him telegram B, and said, ""This is a forged telegram, sent to Arthur Thompson,"" and that I understood he had called for the letter—he said, ""Yes""—I asked him what he had done with the money—he said that he kept half—I asked him what he had done with the other half—he said, ""I do not wish to say""—I said, ""Is it a relative?""—he said, ""No""—I asked him how long he had lived at 47, Beaufort Street—he said, ""Three years""—I said, ""With whom?""—he said, ""Mr. Sweet""—I said, ""I must send to him and inquire""—I went back to the Central Office and made further inquiries, and on my return he said, ""You have heard the name of the man to whom I sent the money?""—I said, ""Do you mean Mr. Shapley?""—he said, ""Yes""—before that I had shown him a telegram and this cheque for £9 14s.—he said that he had received that money and handed half of it to a man in the Post Office—I saw Shapley next morning, who said that he had had half of the money, that he did not know anything about the

forged telegram, but the reason he had half the money was that he and Baker both sent half the deposit money—I gave him in custody.

Cross-examined. Baker was quite open about the matter, except as to the question as to who was in the Post Office.

Baker, in his defence, stated on oath, that he agreed with Shapley to try his luck upon horse racing, and to receive letters in the name of Thompson; that they sent £2 10s. each to Guernsey, and that he sent 15 or 16 telegrams there from Waterloo Place, Regent Street, close to the Admiralty, and some from King's Road, Chelsea; that they lost upon 12 of them £14 or £15, and won £3; that he sent Mr. Magnum, of Liverpool, five telegrams, and lost upon these and won upon two; that he knew that the telegram of January 15th was going to be sent, but did not know that it was to be forged, as Shapley often got information at the Post Office by wire; that five of the forged telegrams, those of January 15th, February 4th and 22nd, and March 1st, were sent by Shapley, and he (Baker) had nothing to do with them; that he found out by calling for the letters that inquiries were being made, but did not know that there was any forgery till he showed them to Shapley, who said that they were forged, and that he then wrote the letter of March 2nd to Guernsey, stating that owing to unforeseen circumstances he should not be able to continue the account, and that he had changed his address, that he might not be seen passing the tobacconist's shop.

Both prisoners received good characters.

BAKER— GUILTY .—Strongly recommended to mercy by the JURY.— Judgment respited. SHAPLEY— Six months' imprisonment in the second division."
Breaking Peace,"FLORENCE MATILDA BROWN . I am single—I live at Rothschild Villas, Acton, with my mother, and am a waitress—I have known the prisoner about two years, and have been keeping company with him—last August I became engaged to him—we often had quarrels, but nothing very serious—I do not know what the quarrels were about—he was very jealous; last February he tried to strangle me—he got hold of me by the throat and shook me—I broke off our engagement—that was on a Tuesday, and on the Saturday he asked me to forgive him and have him back again—I did so, but was not engaged to him; I became on friendly terms with him—on Saturday, April 20th, I was going home about 8.45 p.m., and saw him following me—I asked him where he was going—he said he was coming to see me—he had rather a disappointed look on his face, as if he did not want me to see him—we walked towards the gate next to our house—I was going to say good-bye to him, when he said he had got some paint round at the side of the house, which he was going to take home—he opened the gate, and I walked in—when we got round the corner of the passage at the side of the house he was on my right side, but not level with me—I did not see anything in his hand—he did not say anything—I saw a flash, heard a report, and felt a stunning blow in my head—I screamed—he placed his hand over my mouth for a moment—he then left me, and I did not see him any more—when he took his hand off my mouth I fell to the ground—I got up and collided with my mother, who had come out—she bathed my wound at once; I was bleeding—she sent for a doctor, who came and attended to me—the prisoner had said he would shoot me if I did not marry him—he said that before the engagement was broken off, and before he attempted to strangle me—I did not take much notice; I never thought he would do it—I have never seen a revolver in his possession, but I think he said he had one, which he kept as a curio, as it proved fatal at a long distance—I am positive that the wound which I received was made by some firearm; it was not done by a blow.

Cross-examined. I think I have said before to-day that the prisoner said he would shoot me if I did not marry him—I did not make any complaint to the police on the night he shot me, because I did not want him arrested—when he tried to strangle me he did not simply push me against the wall; he caught hold of my throat—if I had not had a collar on he would have done me some harm—he did it in a temper—when I met him on April 20th he wanted me to go out the next day—I told him a lady friend of mine was going out with me, and that I should want a rest in the afternoon, but I would meet him at 6.30 p.m.—when I heard the report, and felt the blow, we were quite close together—the shot was fired at the back of me—whatever he fired with must have been in his right hand—my mother did not hear the pistol-shot; she heard me screaming—she was not very close—the kitchen was at the back, and we have some open ground there, so no doubt the sound went over the open ground instead of going to the kitchen—I suppose the wind took the sound of the pistol-shot towards the house, seven houses away, if a man heard it there—no bullet has been found; it has been searched for—no marks of powder were found on my hat—my mother said there were some dark marks on my hair, but she bathed me at once—it was not blood; it was a dirty colour—there was no powder there when the doctor came—I have never had a violent blow before—I do not know what it is like—when my mother came up I said, ""Mother, he has shot me""—I know I was shot.

HENRY NICHOLLS (Police Sergeant, 11 T) produced and proved a plan of the locality.

CLARA BROWN . I am a widow, and live at 19, Rothschild Villas, Acton Green, and am the prosecutrix's mother—on April 20th, about 9 p.m., I was in my kitchen at the back of my house, preparing supper—I heard a scream—I ran out, and saw my daughter—she said, ""Fred has shot me""—we went into the kitchen—I saw some marks at the side of her head—I ran for some water and bathed her—her hair seemed to be dirty—I got some more water, as the first became dirty—blood was running down her face—I did not dress the wound; I sent for the doctor—I heard no report of a pistol.

Cross-examined. My daughter has been engaged to the prisoner about two years—I understood that there was an engagement at the time this happened—the first water was certainly not darkened by blood—my daughter had told me she had been shot—I was very frightened—I am quite sure the basin I used was clean.

WILLIAM HENRY DAVY . I am a clerk, of 12, Rothschild Road, Acton—about 9 p.m. on April 20th I was walking towards my house with my wife—I went into my back kitchen; the kitchen and scullery windows were wide open—I heard a report as from a firearm a short distance away; I cannot say how far; it sounded very near—I did not do anything; I was interested in an account of a football match at the Crystal Palace—I did not hear any screams then—I do not remember if I did later on.

Cross-examined. I did not hear any scream at all—the prosecutrix's house is 45 or 50 yards away—my wife heard the report—I cannot remember if I mentioned it to her at the time—I did not go out to make enquiries; I was too interested in the report of the football match—I

have never fired a firearm—I first heard of this case the following Monday morning.

ROBERT GEORGE CHRISTY . I am a registered medical practitioner, of Rothschild Road, Acton Green—on April 20th, about 9 a.m., I was sent for to Mrs. Brown's house—I went there, and saw the prosecutrix—she had a wound on the right side of her head, a little above the ear; it was bleeding—it was about 1/2in. or 3/4in. long—it commenced apparently in front, as it was much shallower there than at the back—it seemed to go under the skin for about 3/4in. or 1/2in.—the depth from the skin towards the bone was about 1/4in.—it might have been caused by a bullet—the wound had been washed before I saw it—I probed it—I found no bullet or foreign matter there—it was not a dangerous wound—the bullet must have fallen out, or was pressed out, if it was a bullet—it came out the same way that it went in—there was no second opening—the tension of the scalp skin might possibly have pressed it out.

Cross-examined. The direction of the wound was from front to back—if the pistol was fired from the back it must have made a wound in an opposite direction—grains of gunpowder cannot be washed out of the skin—the wound was a cul-de-sac—the bullet would have to come back to get out—a sharp stone could have caused the wound.

Re-examined. The direction of the wound was consistent with the man standing on the girl's right side—it would be possible to wash out the discolouration from the smoke of the revolver—there are small toy revolvers which throw no powder at all.

By the COURT. If I had not heard anything about shooting I should have said that something had penetrated the skin—if it had been a stone it would make a big bruise, and if it was a sharp stone it would scratch the skin—a fall on a spike might have caused it, or any sharp instrument, except a knife—it had not the appearance of a knife—it would have to be something larger than a pin.

WALTER DEW (Police Inspector, T) On April 21st I received information, in consequence of which I went to the prisoner's house—I did not find him there—I traced him to Liverpool—I sent a telegram to the Liverpool police, stating what train the prisoner was in, and they arrested him—I went down with Inspector Fowler, and found him detained—I said to him, ""We are two police officers; is your name Frederick Sully?""—he said, ""Yes""—I said, ""I am going to arrest you for attempting to murder your sweetheart, Florence Matilda Brown, by shooting her in the head, at Acton Green, on the 20th; you understand?""—he said, ""Yes, I understand""—I subsequently conveyed him to London, and he was charged at Hammersmith Police-court—he made no reply—a letter was handed to me by the Liverpool police, with an address in America on it; it was found on him when he was arrested.

Cross-examined. The prisoner has been in England about two years—he was formerly in Australia—I understand that he is a hard-working, industrious man—I could not find anybody else who heard the report of the pistol, as it was Saturday night, and a great many people were out marketing—I have searched for the bullet and revolver, but several hours after the occurrence.

The prisoner, in his defence, on oath, said that he did not shoot the prosecutrix,

but he was angry with her, and, feeling something under his foot, he picked it up and struck her with it, but that he did not know if it was a stone or a brick, or a piece of wood.

HENRY NICHOLLS (Re-examined) There is a railway line at the back of the house—it is about 200 yards away—there is continual shunting of trains there.

GUILTY of unlawful wounding .— Three months' hard labour."
Violent Theft,"PATRICK REGAN . I live at 24, Marlborough Road, Chelsea, and am a labourer—at 11.10 p.m. on June 1st I was standing at the corner of Marlborough Road listening to a crowd of people singing—the prisoner came up and stood in front of me with his back towards me, and I felt a tug at my watch—I looked down and saw him with it in his hand—I got hold of his arm and he threw the watch into the crowd—I picked it up and he struck me and walked away—I followed him and gave him into custody.

Cross-examined by the Prisoner. I am sure you are the man.

MARGARET REGAN . I am the wife of the prosecutor—I was with him on this night—my husband said he had missed his watch and I saw the prisoner throw it over his shoulder into the crowd.

Cross-examined. I am sure you are the man.

CHRISTOPHER REGAN . I am 16, and am the prosecutor's son—I did not see the prisoner until my father said he had lost his watch—I then saw the prisoner throw it over his shoulder, and as my father picked it up he was struck in the eye by the prisoner.

WILLIAM EVANS (17 B.R.) I was called to take the prisoner into custody—when charged he said. ""All right.""

GUILTY†of robbery. He then pleaded guilty to a conviction of felony at North London Sessions on September 3rd. 1901. Twenty months' hard labour."
Royal Offences,"WILLIAM CHARLES SMITH . I am barman to William Henry Barnes, of the Wheatsheaf, High Street, Camden Town—on Saturday, July 5th, between 12.10 and 12.20 a.m., I served the prisoners and another man with drinks coming to 4 1/2d.—Price put this coin (Produced) on the bar—I said, ""This won't do""—the prisoners were standing together—Price said, ""You have seen some of these before""—I said, ""No, I have not,"" and gave him back the coin—he gave me silver and I gave him the change—I went to serve in another bar—I noticed Price picking up silver in the same bar where Mills was serving about two minutes afterwards—they drank their liquor and went out—I looked in the till and saw this gilt coin again—I jumped the counter and ran after the prisoners in the street—they were walking hurriedly away—in about fifty yards I stopped them—I showed Price the coin, and said, ""What is your game?""—he said, ""I have made a mistake,"" put his hand in his pocket, and brought out some silver—the potman came up and said we had better go back, and we all went back to the Wheatsheaf—the prisoners spoke to Barnes—I do not know the third man who was with us—he was not pointed out to the police who came.

Cross-examined by MR. ABINGER. The bar is nearest the High Street—the men walked back at once—I do not know the prisoners' characters—they are not customers—they had two mild-and-bitters and an old six—that is Burton and mild—they had been drinking, but were not drunk—they were in good spirits—the head on this coin resembles a sovereign—the bar compartment is about four feet wide—I would not have served them if they had been drunk—I have been in the trade seventeen years—I have never before known anyone foolish enough to try to pass such a coin—any barman would notice it—the barmaid had been there two days—the bar was well lighted.

Re-examined. Price spoke clearly.

HARRIETT SIBTHORP MILLS . I am barmaid at the Wheatsheaf, Camden Town—in the early morning of July 5th when I was serving I noticed the prisoners—Price asked me if I could change a sovereign—he put this coin head upwards on the bar—it looked like and I took it to be a sovereign—I put it on the till—I gave him half a sovereign and ten shillings silver—the bar was well lighted—I have had experience in changing money—there was no other gold on the till—I saw the barman get over the bar.

Cross-examined by MR. ABINGER. I have now been a barmaid at the Wheatsheaf about a fortnight—this has not the ring of a sovereign—Price did not ring it—he was not particularly drunk, he had had enough.

WILLIAM HENRY BARNES . I am the landlord of the Wheatsheaf—about 12.20 a.m. on Saturday, July 5th, my attention was called to the prisoners in the bar by seeing my barman jump over the counter—he soon returned with the prisoners and a third man—the barman handed me this coin, and said, pointing to Price, ""This man has changed this over the counter for a sovereign, and went away, and I went after him""—the prisoners asked my pardon, and said they would apologise, they only did it for a lark—I sent the potman for a policeman—the prisoners were strangers—both were searched somewhere adjoining the saloon bar—I went with three constables and the two prisoners to the station—another coin was found.

Cross-examined by MR. ABINGER. They were neither drunk nor sober and I ought to be a judge of that—they were what I should term the happy medium—they did not produce a coin to me.

Re-examined. They spoke nervously, but not as if they were drunk—I would not have served them if they had been—Price paid me back 20s.—I demanded it.

WILLIAM WALKER (200 S.) I was sent for early on July 5th—Constable Staniforth came in just afterwards—I found the prisoners and Barnes and Smith in the bar—the potman came for me—the landlord said, ""This man here has changed a sovereign with my barmaid""—afterwards he said that he wished to charge them—Price said afterwards, ""I bought them up at the market,"" and ""We were having a bit of a game I bought them up at the Cattle Market; there were two of them; here is the other""—he handed me the other coin in the bar—on searching them in a private place adjoining the saloon bar we found 14s. 4 1/2d. in good coins on Price, and on Rider 18s. 11d.—on the way to the station Price said,

""It is an error""—when the charge was read over he said, ""I am very sorry.""

Cross-examined by MR. ABINGER. I have made inquiries about both—they are both of the highest respectability and honesty—both appeared to have been drinking—Price handed me the coin before I asked him anything.

SAMUEL STANIFORTH (388 S.) I was called in to the Wheatsheaf about 12.15 a.m. on July 5th—the landlord said that he wished to give the prisoners into custody on the charge of obtaining 20s. by means of false pretences—on that charge I took Rider to the police station, where he said, ""It is all a mistake; we gave 2d. for them in the Cattle Market. When I found we had got 20s. we were coming back, but we were met by a man when I saw these gentlemen,"" indicating my brother officer and me—I searched Rider—I found on him 10s. gold, 8s. silver, and 11d. copper, all good coins.

Cross-examined by MR. ABINGER. From inquiries we find the prisoners have excellent characters—I had one coming case about five years ago.

The prisoners, in their defences on oath, both denied that they had any intention to defraud."
Killing,"ALICE PADWICK . I am the wife of Henry Padwick of 19, Settle Cottages, Sage Street. Shad well—the deceased was my mother—she was twice married—first of all to a Mr. Burns and then to a Mr. Smith—I was Miss Burns before I was married—my sister's name is Ellen Burns, and I have two children named Maude and Henry, they are five and three years old—my mother lived at 131, Cornwall Street, St. George's-in-the-East—she occupied a back bedroom on the ground floor—my children slept with her in the same bed—since my step-father died my mother slept with her head towards the foot of the bed because she could then put the lamp on the chest of drawers, as she used to read in bed—the children slept the other way in the bed, with their feet towards my mother's—my sister also slept in the same room—Mr. Smith died in May—I have known the prisoner for seven months—he has lodged at my mother's for about that time—he occupied a back room on the first floor—he shared it with a man named Macarthy—that is the top floor—there is only one story to the house—the prisoner used to go to sea now and again—the name of his last ship was the Komoa—when he was not at sea he used to lodge at 131, Cornwall Street—I believe he was going to sea the Saturday following my mother's death—I do not know if he paid any rent for his room—since Mr. Smith's death I have not noticed anything more than friendliness between the prisoner and the deceased—on July 17th I and my mother went to a police fete at the Crystal Palace—we got home about midnight—on the 18th we went home in the evening—the prisoner was in the kitchen—he said to my mother,"" You have been with the coppers ain't you""—my mother said, ""Have we, what has that to do with you""—the prisoner was sober to my knowledge—on July 21 I and my mother went to the Pavilion Theatre—we got back about midnight—I saw the prisoner in the kitchen, sitting on a chest which my step-father used to use when he went to sea—I think he had been drinking in the day but he knew what he was talking about when we got home—he spoke sensibly to us—he said to my mother, ""You have been with the coppers again—my mother did not answer him, she only laughed—the prisoner walked upstairs as if he was going to bed,

and I went away home—I saw him again next day about 2 p.m., going along the street—he was going from one public-house to another—about 4 p.m. I saw him coming through Sutton Street, he was going to Ellis's beer-house—I did not speak to him—I think he had been drinking by the looks of him—I did not see him again that night—it was my practice to go to my mother's house about 9.30 every morning, and on July 23rd I went there at that time for my children—I went into the kitchen and then to my mother's bedroom—the door was half open—I saw my two children—Maude was sitting up in bed awake and Henry was asleep—they were both in their usual places at the head of the bed—I noticed some blood at the foot of the bed on the sheet, there were no other clothes on the bed—my mother was lying on the floor, with her head towards the window and her feet towards the head of the bed—I think she had a quilt, a blanket and a sheet round her—I saw blood on her face and chest—I took my children away and put them in the kitchen and shut the door—I called in Mrs. Harris before that—I went to Dr. Habageon—I did not move my mother's body at all—the doctor followed me round—my brother, George Burns, joined the doctor—he was also sleeping in the house in the little off room over the kitchen—I was shown this knife at the inquest (Produced.)—it belonged to my step-father—I believe he gave it to the prisoner—I have seen it in his possession—he used to cut tobacco with it—that is since my step-father died.

Cross-examined. I believe the prisoner had a considerable amount of money when he first left his ship and went to my mother's house—I do not know if he had £28—while he was living in the house he did casual work at the dock—I do not know that he spent his money at public-houses—he was not frequently drunk, he was sometimes—I have often seen him drunk, and especially latterly—he appeared to be friendly disposed towards my mother and myself, and he was very kind to my children.

ANN HARRIS . I am the wife of Robert Harris and lodge in the first floor front room at 131, Cornwall Street—I have been there about eight weeks—I have known the prisoner for about six months—on Monday, July 21st, I went with the deceased and Mrs. Padwick to the Pavilion Theatre—we got back about midnight—I saw the prisoner in the kitchen—he said to the deceased, ""You have been after the coppers again""—she did not say anything—next day about 7.30 p.m. I was in the yard—I saw the prisoner and the deceased in the kitchen—he was sitting on a box, and she was sitting on the chair by the fire—I do not know if they were talking—I and the deceased went into the Railway Arms about 7.30 p.m.—the prisoner followed us in—he had been drinking, but he was not drunk then, ""he was jolly in drink—the deceased had some drink and gave the prisoner a glass of ale—the deceased and I were sitting down together, the prisoner had his back against the partition—he pulled this knife (Produced) from his pocket, it was open when he took it out—he said to the deceased, ""Are you going out to-night""—she said ""No""—he asked her the same question again and she said ""No""—then he closed the knife, drank up his ale and walked out—when he asked her if she was going out that night

the knife was lying open in his open hand—we did not remain long in the public house after the prisoner had left—I did not see him again that night—he had been in the public-house about ten minutes—next morning about 9.30 I heard Mrs. Padwick call—up to that time I had not heard any unusual sounds in the house—I went into the bedroom and saw the deceased lying on the floor—I did not see or hear the prisoner that morning—on the ground floor the deceased slept with her daughter Ellen and two grandchildren—nobody slept in the front ground room that night—in the first floor back room the deceased's son, George Burns, slept, he was alone as far as I know—in the front room there was myself, my niece, and my children.

Re-examined. As far as I could see he was not drunk when he produced the knife in the public-house.

GEORGE BURNS . I live at 131, Cornwall Street—I occupy the little room at the back on the first floor—when I came back from South Africa on Easter Tuesday I found the prisoner lodging in my mother's house—on July 22nd I saw the prisoner in the kitchen about 7 p.m.—he was sitting in a chair—he fell off the chair on to the floor—he had been asleep—he lay down on the floor, and I went out—I do not know how long he stayed on the floor—I was in the kitchen about ten minutes—he was lying asleep on the ground for that time—I do not know what condition he was in—I did not speak to him—I did not see him again that night—I was called by my sister, Mrs. Padwick, between 10 and 10.30 p.m.—up to that time I had heard nothing unusual—I went into my mother's room and assisted the doctor to move my mother's body from the bed.

Cross-examined. When the prisoner tumbled off the chair on the 22nd I do not know if he was drunk—I thought he was a bit drunk—I had seen him drunk on the nights before—I do not know if he and my mother were on friendly terms—I was at work—they always seemed good friends.

CHARLES MCCARTHY . I am a stevedore and live at 131, Cornwall Street—I know the prisoner—for about a fortnight before the death of the deceased I occupied the same bedroom as the prisoner—the deceased was my sister—on July 22nd I got home about 10.30 p.m.—I then went into the Railway Arms—I saw the prisoner there—he was drinking ale—I had some drink-when I left the public-house about 12 p.m. I left the prisoner behind in the house—he was about half drunk—I went home, and about 12.30 the prisoner came in with the deceased—she had been in the public-house for about half an hour—she had a glass of ale there—when I left, I left her there—she and the prisoner seemed pretty sociable together—when they came home they sat down and had something to eat together—I left them

there and went up to bed about 12.45—I did not notice anything strange about them—the deceased was sober—there was nothing to drink for supper—the prisoner came up to bed about one or a little later—he took his jacket off and kept his shirt, trousers, and boots on, and lay down on his bed—I went to sleep—I woke up about 2.30 a.m.—the prisoner was not in the room—he generally took off his things when he went to bed—I went to the water-closet, and to get there I had to pass the kitchen door—I did not take a light with me—there was a lamp burning in the passage, and I saw the prisoner lying on a chest in the kitchen—with the aid of a chair he could make a lie down on it—I thought he was asleep—I did not speak to him—I went back to bed—at 5.15 a.m. the deceased called me as usual by calling up the stairs—I did not get up at once, I dozed off again, and the prisoner came in and woke me about 6 or 6.10—he was dressed in the same way as he had been when I saw him in the kitchen—when the deceased called me the prisoner was not in the room—when he woke me I said, ""What time is it?""—he said, ""Six or 10 past; ain't you going to turn to? '—I said, ""Yes, I will turn out""—he said, ""I have been down in the yard and had a good sluish, and am going to have a lay down; I have got plenty of time to lay down before I sign; I do not want to get down before 10 o'clock, so there is plenty of time for me""—he was going to sign on a ship, I think—he was a boatswain—I got up and walked into the yard—he went to bed—I did not stop to see if he undressed—I got back again about 9.30.

Cross-examined. It was very""unusual for him to go down and sleep on the chest—I had never known him to do it before.

By the COURT. He did not look stupid when he woke me at six—he looked nice and fresh—he had had a good sluish—I think what drink he had had overnight he had got clear of.

ELLEN BURNS . I live at 131, Cornwall Street, and am the deceased's daughter—I slept in the same bed with her, with a nephew and niece of mine—I slept at the same end of the bed as the children—my mother slept the other way with her feet towards me in order to get the light to read by—on July 23rd I got up about 7.30 a.m.—I heard someone come down-stairs—I thought it was the prisoner by his walk—it sounded as if the person had no boots on—he went into the kitchen, and I thought he went to the side-board where the knife tray is kept—then he went upstairs—I went out to work about 7.55—I said good-bye to my mother, and left her and the two children in bed—about 10.30 I was fetched back again to the house.

Cross-examined. I did not see the man who came downstairs—there was no creeping or secrecy—my mother's brother was sleeping upstairs at that time—I have seen the prisoner drunk once or twice.

Re-examined. I do not know what time my mother's brother left the house.

PHILIP ELLIS . I am the landlord of the Railway Arms, Sutton Street, which is about fifty yards from Cornwall Street—I have known the prisoner on and off for three or four years—the deceased and her husband during his lifetime have been customers of mine—on Tuesday, July 22nd, the

prisoner came in with the deceased and Mrs. Harris—the prisoner left about 10.30 p.m.—the females did not stop there all the time, they were there off and on—about 7.30 I see the prisoner with a knife in his hand, but I did not take much notice because it is the usual custom for seafaring men to cut their tobacco with a knife—the knife was open—the prisoner was standing facing the deceased—the females left at 12.17—on July 23rd the prisoner came in between 8 and 8.30 a.m.—he was fully dressed—he asked for a glass of ale, which I gave him—he asked for another, which I gave him—then he asked for a sub.—I knew he was going to sign on his ship, and I gave him 6d.—it would have been returned to me by the deceased, who would also have paid for the drink out of the prisoner's advance note—he said 6d. was not enough, as he wanted to get some breakfast, and he did not want to wake Mog up, meaning the deceased—I gave him a second 6d., and he left the house—he was in the house about eight minutes—he was perfectly sober.

Cross-examined. I should not dream of serving a man who was not perfectly sober—there were other people in the house when the prisoner came in in the morning, but not in the same bar.

HERBERT CROSS (524 City.) At 10.55 on July 23rd, I was in Arthur Street, W.—I saw the prisoner, his manner was peculiar, he was walking up and down in a strange manner, he was fully dressed—I said to him, ""What is up, my boy,"" he said ""I can tell you something""—I touched him on the arm and asked him to walk up the street—several people got round, we walked up the street several yards—he then said, ""I am a murderer, I murdered my wife this morning""—I walked up into Cannon Street with him, I asked him where he had murdered his wife, he would not tell me—I walked up Martin's Lane with him, he wanted to go towards London Bridge—I said, ""You must come with me""—I got hold of his arm, he began to pull away towards London Bridge—I called another constable to come and assist me—we took the prisoner to the station, he tried to throw us to the ground—at the station he produced this knife from his right-hand trousers pocket, and said, ""This is what I did it with at 131, Cornwall Street, E.""—nothing had been said to him, he was cautioned by the station inspector, and he then said, ""I did it, I have done for her""—inquiries were made, it was found to be correct, he was taken to Shadwell and charged—when I saw him in the street I thought he had recovered from a good drinking bout the night before, and had had one or two half-pints the same morning, and that he had something on his mind—he spoke rationally, he had a strange look.

Cross-examined. I have seen men recovering from drinking bouts, and he resembled (hose men—I went up to him to question him as to his mind.

JOHN PICKETT (Inspector H.) On July 23rd, about 1 p.m. I went to Cloak Lane Police Station, where I found the prisoner detained; I said to him, ""I understand you have given yourself up for murder; I must caution you, as you will be charged; ""he replied, ""Right, I gave myself up because I done it""; he was taken to Shadwell Station and charged; he made no

reply to the charge—on July 29th, he was taken to the inquest on the body of the deceased, and on the way back to the police court he said, ""I owed the old girl £16, but I have made a statement up above about it""—those are his exact words—I did not question him about that, because he seemed as if he did not want to say anything more about it.

Cross-examined.—I thought he seemed to be recovering from a very heavy drinking bout, when I saw him at the station at 1 o'clock he seemed very ill.

ALFRED GOULD (Detective-Sergeant H.) On July 23rd, I was at Shad well Police Station; about 1.30 I saw the prisoner there; he was dressed in an ordinary suit—I examined his shirt, on the front of it and on the right sleeve I found what appeared to be spots of blood; it was wet with water, as if an attempt had been made to obliterate the spots—the whole of his clothing was submitted to Dr. Grant on the 24th with this knife—the Komoa was about to sail on the 24th—the practice on that line was for the men to sign on on board.

Cross-examined. The prisoner appeared to be recovering from a drinking bout.

By the JURY. He appeared to be rational when he spoke.

ERNEST THOMAS HABERGEON . I am a registered medical practioner of 273, Cable Street—about 9.30 on July 23rd, I was called by Mrs. Padwick to 131, Cornwall Street—I went to a room on the ground floor, and found the deceased lying on the floor—she was quite dead, the body had a chemise on: around the lower part were the bedclothes—it was lying alongside the bed with the head towards the window—I placed the body on the bed—I saw blood on the chemise and bed clothes; blood had been issuing from the nose, and there was a clot on the floor beneath the neck—I should think she had been dead about an hour, parts of the body were warm—next day I made a post-mortem examination—the body was that of a strongly-built well-developed woman, the organs were fairly healthy, with the exception of a slight fatty degeneration of the heart—I found five wounds, one a stab over the region of the heart in the second intercostal space, with a bruise outside it, the stab being some 3 1/2 inches deep—I came to the conclusion that that was the first injury which had been inflicted—I think the cause of death was shock, occasioned by that stab—the second wound was upon the right side of the neck, between the lobe of the ear and the joint between the breast and collar bones, two inches deep; it wounded the external jugular vein—the third wound was on the right shoulder blade 2 3/4 inches deep; the fourth on the right side, and wounded the right lung slightly, passed the fifth rib and slightly wounded the liver, it was 3 1/2 inches deep—the fifth wound was in the seventh intercostal space on the right side, and in the diaphragm, and about four inches deep—those wounds could have been inflicted by this knife, and must have been inflicted with very great violence indeed; there was a cut in the chemise—I did not examine the bed-clothes.

Cross-examined. Death would follow almost immediately after the wound in the heart: the other wounds would have been entirely unnecessary.

By the COURT. I do not think she could make any noise; there might be a gurgle, but no crying out.

----GRANT. The prisoner's clothing was handed to me for examination, on his trousers I found a woman's hair, and similar in colour to the deceased's—I found a stain on the shirt button, and came to the conclusion that it was blood, and there had been an attempt to wash away blood from the upper part of the waistcoat—I found blood in the nail slit of the knife blade—I examined the bed clothes which were round the deceased—there were holes in them; very great violence must have been used; the injuries were deeper than the length of the knife—I think she was asleep when she was stabbed—I think she rolled over or her side, then received the other blows, and probably completed the turn and rolled on to the floor—if she had been awake, she would have made an effort to defend herself, her hands were not cut, but were covered with blood—I presume she placed her hand over the first wound inflicted.

GUILTY of manslaughter. Twelve years' penal servitude."
Deception,"JOSEPH RAYMOND . I am manager of the ""Cold Storage and Ice Trades Review,"" of 19, Ludgate Hill—the prisoner was employed by the firm as an advertisement canvasser—on July 27th he brought me this order (Produced) purporting to come from Messrs. Pooley, weigh-bridge manufacturers—he told me he had been to their Fleet Street branch, and had seen Mr. Pooley and had got the order from him—the signature is more like ""Pollin"" than ""Pooley,"" and I told him so—he replied, ""Whether it is 'Pollin' or 'Pooley,' Mr. A. M. Pooley signed it in my presence and gave it to me""—the order was for £30 and his remuneration was 25 per cent.—he had had £2 8s. previously, and I paid him £5 2s.—the same day I wrote to Messrs. Pooley acknowledging the order, and by return of post received a letter from them repudiating it—I then sent a telegram to their head office at Birmingham and received a letter from there confirming their other letter—I wrote to the prisoner about it and the letter was returned marked ""House empty.""

Cross-examined. The prisoner first canvassed for ""Cold Storage about June last—prior to that he had canvassed for ""Health Resort.' A paper of which, I was secretary—about a month before July 27th he told

me lie thought he should be able to get an order from Pooley's, and; on that I advanced him £2 8s. in three instalments—it is quite usual for canvassers to share commissions—I am positive the prisoner told me that Mr. Pooley had signed the order in his presence.

SAMUEL DERBYSHIRE . I am managing clerk to Hy, Pooley and Sons, Limited—this order for an advertisement does not come from my firm—I know the writing of all the members of the firm, and the signature A. M. Pooley is not any of theirs—there is no A. M. Pooley in the firm at all—an advertising order for £30 would not be given in London, but at Birmingham.

Cross-examined. Small orders are given in London—I do not know anyone named Beard—there is not a Mr. Pooley in London attending to the business—this advertisement in ""Gold Storage"" has been copied from our catalogue, which is given away freely.

FREDERICK HOLMES . (City Detective Inspector.) I arrested the prisoner at 18, Beechcroft Terrace, Woodford—I read the warrant to him-he said, ""I know all about it, I have a perfect answer to the charge.""

The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he did not get an order from Pooley's personally, but arranged with a fellow canvasser named Beard to get it, who gave him the order form already signed; that he paid Beard £3 1s. 6d. for getting the order, and had every reason to believe it to be genuine; and that he did not tell Mr. Raymond that Mr. Pooley had signed the order in his presence.

The prisoner received a good character.

NOT GUILTY ."
Deception,"I am in the Accountant Generals Department of the General Post Office, and produce Exhibits A, B, C, and D.

FLORENCE GROUT . I am a clerk at Clerkenwell Green Post Office—on August 13th the prisoner handed me this telegram: ""Just returned burnt out safe telegraph immediate £5 Arthur Barnes Lawrence, Lambeth Post Office London""—I saw him write it at the counter; it was dispatched.

REV. ASHLEY LAWRENCE BARNES LAWRENCE . I am Vicar of Aberford, Yorkshire—I have a brother, Arthur Evelyn Barnes Lawrence—on August 13th, about 4 p.m., I received this telegram purporting to be signed by my brother—I doubted it and telegraphed to the Metropolitan Police.

MARTHA JANE CROUCHER . On August 13th I was housemaid to Mr. Arthur Barnes Lawrence, who was in Switzerland at that time—we have not had a fire at the house at all.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. I have never seen you at the House—there are no other servants in the house.

JOHN BEARD . (Detective-Sergeant L.) On August 13th, about 7 p.m., I went to Lambeth Post Office—at 7.45 I saw the prisoner enter the office, and followed him in—he said to one of the clerks, ""Have you received a telegraph money order for £5 for Arthur Barnes Lawrence?""—I turned to him and told him I was a police officer and should take him into custody—he said, ""This is a fair cop: I am not Lawrence""—he was taken to Kennington Road Station and detained—on him I found a telegram and a book containing writing which he said had reference to a competition in ""Pearson's.""

KATE STANILAND . I am in the employ of the Post Office at 227, Walworth Road—on July 29th I took in this telegram: ""Luckock Deanery Lichfield. Accident motoring to town, wire remittance 175 Walworth Road S.E. From R. Mortimer Luckock""—I cannot recognise the person who handed it in.

ARTHUR MORTIMER LUCKOCK . I live at the Deanery, Lichfield—on July 29th I received a telegram: ""Accident motoring to town, wire remittance 175 Walworth Road S.E. R. Mortimer Luckock""—I have a brother of that name, and I thought it came from him—I sent £3, and telegraphed ""227, Walworth Road. Arthur M. Luckock pays £3 for Russell M. Luckock, 175, Walworth Road.""

FREDERICK WILLIAM LEWIS . I am a newsagent of 175, Walworth Road—on July 29th a boy brought Exhibit G to me: ""Please keep any letter or telegram for R. Luckock""—the same afternoon a telegram came addressed ""Luckock,"" and shortly afterwards a boy brought a note to me and I gave him the telegram—I received a penny for taking it in.

EMILY WHITE . I am a Post Office clerk at 19, Borough High Street—on July 29th I was engaged at the Walworth Road Post Office, and Exhibit C, a money order for the payment of £3, was given to me to pay—I cannot, recollect whether it was signed in my presence—on August 14th I was, taken to Kennington Road Police Station and asked to identify the man who presented it from about ten others—I identified the prisoner.

RUSSELL MORTIMER LUCKOCK . I belong to the King's Own Regiment stationed at Aldershot—Exhibits A and C purport to be signed by me—neither are in fact signed by me—I did not receive the £3.

GUILTY . Eighteen months' hard labour."
Deception,"MARGARET ELIZABETH DACRE . I am now living at 87. Catherine Road, East Ham—I formerly lived at 537, Victoria Road, Melbourne, where I supported myself by teaching music up to the spring of this year—I was a widow—my name was Liddle—I inserted an advertisement in the Melbourne Age, and through that got into correspondence with the prisoner about May this year—I also met him in Melbourne; be gave the name of Ernest John Dacre—he said he was a photographer and importer, and that he had remittances of £140 a year from his estate in England, that he was born in Stepney, that his father was an officer in the Army, and was the owner of an estate in Gloucestershire worth £16,000, from which his mother was receiving an income, that he was two removes from the title of Baron Dacre, and was related to the Brandts, the Governor of New South Wales, that he had been an officer in the Army, and had got into debt to the extent of £11.000, and so had cut off his entail, but that his brothers were dead and the property would come to him—after a time I told him I was alone in the world and in delicate health—he asked me if I desired to get married, and professed to be very fond of me—at first he said we would get married and go to

Sydney, and he wrote to Sydney, but he changed his mind and said he wanted to go to England, as his family was there and his mother was dying, and that he was in a delicate state of health—I told him I had advanced £400 on mortgage on a house in Brunswick, and that I had £140 or £150 in the Savings Bank, and two other loans amounting to about £100 on a promisory note and a bill of sale—he said of course I must dispose of my property, and he put advertisements in the newspapers—I paid for the advertisements—the marriage was fixed for June 28th, about a fortnight before that time, because he said he wanted to go home by the Macedonia, he asked me if I could dispose of my property in the time—I said, ""Yes, with a lot of hard work""; but I did it with his help—he did all the business of trying to get in the money—he said he had no money to take the passages, but if I would advance money to enable him to take them he would pay me back within two or three days after arrival in England, and I lent him £150 out of sums which I drew out of the bank—I agreed to take £380 in full settlement of the £400 mortgage money, and I was paid £380 in bank notes at the Union Bank of Melbourne—of that I lent him £40—he said, ""You had better let me settle up, and he went to several offices, and eventually settled on Cook's—he asked me to make him a belt that he could wear it round his waist—I said no, I would have a draft—he said it was an unnecessary expense, and that Cook's, the tourists, charged £9—I gave him the £340 to get the draft, and when he came back he told me he had taken £15 out of the £340, leaving £325, for which he said he had a draft at Cook's—I did not authorize him to do that—he never showed me the draft—I went with him to the Melbourne Post Office on June 27th, the day before the marriage, to register a letter—the officials asked my name; I said, ""Margaret Elizabeth Dacre""—I wanted to be married first and use the name of Dacre afterwards, but he raised objections of all sorts—I said I was doing all this, but I was not Mrs. Dacre—he said he had a lot of business, and if the marriage was the next day it did not mutter—he handed in the registered letter, and I saw him write on it—he said, ""I will take charge of this""—(Receipt produced for registered letter addressed ""E. J. Dacre, London, England"")—on the voyage he threatened to desert me, and I asked him for the receipt for the money, and he gave me this—I said, ""It is in your name""—he said, ""But the draft is in your name""—at Melbourne Post Office I did not know what the address on the letter was, nor the initials, nor what was in it, excepting what he told me—I had in Melbourne a piano, pictures, and books and music—I wanted to take the music—he said there was no necessity to take music, there was plenty at his mother's home—I said, ""I wish to have my own music, it is very valuable, worth at least about £30,"" but I had to leave it behind and my prizes—the moveable furniture he took to the shipping agents—he said they had already gone by cargo ship and that they were consigned to King and Co., England—I thought they were in my name—he did not tell me the name—the value was about £300—it was consigned before I was married—I took some trunks in my cabin and there was larger luggage in the hold, not all mine—on June 28th I

was married to the prisoner in Melbourne, and we sailed by the Macedonia the same day—I had two boxes and a Gladstone bag in the cabin—the prisoner had also luggage—I got this receipt for the registered letter for the first time on board—I asked the prisoner for it—I saw very little of him from morning to night, only at meals, and every morning he was very disagreeable, saying nasty things and making unpleasant comments—on August 6th we arrived at Plymouth—we went to the Waverley Hotel with some of my luggage—I understood it was all at Plymouth—the prisoner said it was to wait there till he heard from his mother—the piano and heavy luggage he told me were on the cargo boat, but it was all on the same ship under the name Dacre and some in the name of Ward—we travelled as Mr. and Mrs. Ward, because he said he got the tickets cheaper through his threatrical company—on August 7th, he said he was going to see his mother in Gloucestershire, to prepare her for my coming, as although he had written to his solicitor that he was engaged, his mother would not be aware of the fact that he had been married, and it would not do to take me to her till he had broken it to her, therefore he would see her first, and come back to me on the Tuesday—he went away on the Sunday night—I had only £2 of my own that I had on the ship, and he said he had only 25s., and he pretended to be very ill, and told me he had better go first class as he was so ill, so he took £1, leaving me £1—he gave me no address where he was going—he said his mother kept a great number of servants in Gloucestershire, but nothing more definite than that, not even the name of the house—I never saw him again at Plymouth—before he left he said he would go to his solicitor the next day, and that he could get hundreds of pounds from him, and would be able to pay me back what I had lent him—I received these letters (Produced) from him, but with no dates or addresses on any of them—(One letter stated ""I have not £10 from the solicitor"" and enclosed £5, and another said, that his mother was disappointed)—they had the London postmark, and I have marked the date on some—the passage in one letter ""I made inquiries, I said I would, I was very much surprised at the time; I did not think it possible you could treat me so"" referred to the fact that I asked him on the ship why I was left entirely to myself, and to give me a little more of his time, and ""where was the bond of sympathy that there was between us before marriage?"" he said, ""Have you been reading a novel? take your hands off me, you make me squirm,"" and he said other nasty things to me—at Plymouth on the Saturday, I told him that the passengers had said, or at all events that one gentleman had said, that he would desert me, and he asked for his name—several people offered their addresses—he said he would ask every officer and every passenger who it was that said he was going to desert me—he writes: ""I ordered letters to be sent to London,"" but he was in London all the time—his luggage was in London—it was never taken off at Plymouth at all—on August 11th he wrote that he had taken a situation temporarily at £2 10s. a week, and on August 13th I received this telegram, addressed to Mrs.

Ward, Waverley Hotel, Plymouth: ""Jack not fit to travel, have kept him back, cancelled his engagement; he writes to-day""—the writing on the back of this form is his writing—I got this telegram on August 14th: ""My dear Bess,—Got back yesterday knocked up, all in a nervous tremble; had to resign job; I shall take rooms or house on Monday and send for you, etc.; ""more to-morrow. Jack""—I got two of his letters in London—on arrival in London on Monday, August 17th, I went straight to Scotland Yard—I received another £1 from him—I got two letters at Charing Cross—I stayed in Portland Street, where a detective told me to stay—I left word at the Plymouth Hotel to forward letters (One letter from the prisoner stated: ""I suppose you have been worrying about me, I have been very bad,' and added that he had been taking advantage of his relative's kindness and care, and was signed ""with love, yours, Jack."") the other enclosed a postal order for £1, and asked for a reply to be sent to ""Poste Restante, Regent Street, S.W.,"" on account of the servants—I went to Charing Cross with the police on August 22nd to examine my luggage—I next saw my husband in Oxford Street on that day—I caught sight of him coming across the road—he stood looking at a shop window, and I waited for him—when he came up I said ""Jack!"" he asked me why I had come, and said that I had upset all his arrangements—he said, ""Jump in a cab""—my lady friend was waiting—I said, ""I cannot do that without speaking to my lady friend""—he said, ""Where is she?""—I said, ""Over there,"" and as I turned my head he turned away into the middle of the road—a hansom cab stopped, and I went after him, and threw my arms around him, and called ""Police!""—he struggled and broke my bag—he nearly got away, but a policeman came up—his hat was knocked off—it was about 8 p.m.—this slip of paper and the draft contain my signatures, ""M. E. Dacre,"" in his writing (These were the specimen signatures given at the head office of the Commercial Bank of Australia in Melbourne and the draft from the same office for £325 dated June 27th, 1904)—I did not authorise him to sign it—I had no knowledge of these signatures having been written—the endorsement on this £50 note, No. 99184, ""F. J. Vincent, 18, Guildford Street,"" is also in the prisoner's writing.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. My first husband was about 19 years of age—I was married in 1895—I did not get that husband through a matrimonial advertisement; nothing of the kind—I did not apprentice him to a dentist—he entered into indentures which you took from amongst my luggage; I stood security for him—during his life I conducted a music business—I lent money on houses, not on promissory notes or bills of sale—my first husband has been dead nearly two years—a postman paid me £15 for the loan of £100 for 18 months—I am not prepared to answer you, I have had a serious illness—you should question my solicitor—I cannot remember my advertisement—I said a lady, age 29, was desirous of meeting a man in a suitable position—my nom de flume was ""Amor,""—I answered ""E. J. D."" at once, but did not call for the letter—I did not interview several other gentlemen—I put

E. Dacre,"" as I was to be married the next day—you put the receipt in your pocket—the money was mine—you gave the initials—I do not say it was your habit to sleep in your cabin in the afternoon, but when I came I got snapped at—I did not go scandalizing, but the people were pitying my being left alone—you asked me their names—I would not give them—you said, ""You can speak the truth, or you are a dangerous woman""—before you were everything, but from the moment I got on the ship I never saw you till 12—I did not mention the name, but someone told me you were going to desert me, and I said no, I thought you were too honourable—you left me at Plymouth with every token of affection, kissing me, and said you would soon be buck—on August 4th I was in bed all day—you took £2 5s.—you might have given me a few shillings—the police told me not to go with you in a cab—I never altered my banking account, under

the bank manager's advice and that of my solicitors I left the account as it was—when I went to see my baggage my Gladstone bag was fastened with wire; I cannot say it was by the Custom House;—I made a list of things missing from my box, and those things were found at Charing Cross—I wanted to take things you objected to; there were two paintings of flowers of Columbo, you said, ""I will put them in my portmanteau, they won't get damaged""—I painted those on the voyage—I did not ask you to pack my dirty linen with yours; I wanted to take it with me—you had yours washed at Columbo, but I was not allowed to have mine washed—the ship stayed there to coal, and we slept ashore one night at an hotel, and one night on the ship—being short of linen I discovered ray things were not at Plymouth at all—all the things in this list are things which would go to the wash—I found in your luggage a new piece of silk, my father's will, and some papers including my first husband's marriage certificate and his indentures—I visited in good society and matriculated—you said your mother would retire and leave the property to us.

Re-examined.

PHILLIP HERBERT GARDNER . I am a clerk at the Commercial Bank of Australia at the London Branch in Bishopsgate Street ""Within—the head office is in Melbourne—in August we received advice by mail from Melbourne as to a draft for £325 with this specimen signature of the payee—on August 10th this draft was presented at the counter and cashed in notes which are entered in a book called the teller's cash book, from which this is a correct extract—there was one note of £100, four of £50, and five of £5.

Cross-examined. These are the first and second of exchange—unless the signature agreed on being compared with the specimen signature; the draft would not have been given.

WILLIAM JESSER COOK .

J, Vincent, 18, Guildford Street."" (The prisoner admitted this signature.)

RICHARD HAROLD DENBY . I am a clerk to Messrs. Cook and Sons, bankers and agents, at Ludgate Circus—they have a branch at Melbourne

Cross-examined. I read it as ""Mrs. Dacre""—there is a mark through the ""s""—I did not observe that, and the matter passed from my recollection.

EDWARD EVERARD. I am a porter at the Charing Cross Hotel—I recognise the prisoner as stopping there in the name of Ward from the beginning of the week commencing August. 7th till Monday, August 15th—I saw him between those dates going to his bed room—so far as I know he was resident in the hotel that week.

ALBERT JOHANSEN . I let rooms at 2, sherwood Street. Piccadilly—on August 15th the prisoner engaged a room and stayed there till August 22nd in the name of Dacre—he had luggage which he took away on august 23rd.

WILLIAM PARRIS (402 D.) About 8 p.m. on August 22nd I was on duty near Oxford Circus when, in consequence of a statement by a lady, I crossed the road and saw the prisoner breaking away from the prosecutrix. and heard her screams—I stopped him and told him he was wanted on a warrant for taking his wife's property and for desertion—he said, ""Don't take hold of my arm and make me look like a criminal""—on the way to the station he said, ""She says there is a warrant; I am glad there is; fancy a man being charged with taking his wife's property; I sent her £1 last Friday; I did not know she was in London""—I tool: him to the station.

Cross-examined. Possibly I said at Bow Street that you were stooping or in a running attitude.

HENRY FOWLER (Detective Sergeant). I was instructed in this case—Mrs. Dacre first came to Scotland Yard on August 17th and made a complaint, in consequence of which I made some inquiries, and on August 19th a warrant was issued at Bow Street—on August 22nd, about 10:30 p.m., I saw the prisoner detained at Marylebone Police Station—I said to him. ""I am a police officer: is your name Ernest John Dacre?""—he said. Yes, that is my name""—I said, ""I hold a warrant for your arrest for stealing some of your wife's property""—he said, ""What is the charge against me?""—I said, ""I will read the warrant to you""—I read it to him—he said. ""Is that all? I can disprove that in two minutes, before the Magistrate""—the warrant charges him with feloniously stealing two sill: dresses, one jacket, two fawn coats, and a quantity of lady's underline:) to the value of £15—I said, ""What is your address?""—he

said, ""I shall want to see a solicitor before I give you that""—I then searched him—in his trousers pockets I found £1 in gold, and in his jacket pocket five £5 Bank of England notes, Nos. 36693-7, dated April 4th, 1904—the prisoner then put his hand in his right hand back trousers pocket and gave me a bundle of twenty-two £5 Bank of England notes, the numbers of which are contained in the forty-five, numbered 97051 to 97095—I also found a watch and chain, latch key, three playing cards and eight visiting cards in the name of E. J. Dacre—I took him to Bow Street—on the way he said, ""Do you call this fraud?""—I said, ""The warrant charges you with stealing""—he said, ""Well, I have travelled all over the world and have had to come back to England to learn that a man can be charged with stealing his wife property; I have written to her, and only last Friday sent her £1; we have been married two months to-day, and this is the end of it; fancy a man in my position being locked up in a cell all night; on our way here from Melbourne, if I passed a chair to another lady it was wrong, and she would tell me of it; I ought to have cut her throat; I ought to have told you before I have got some more money on me; it is in my boot""—I said, ""I shall have to search you again when we get to Bow Street""—he said, I forgot to tell you before""—on arriving at Bow Street, on the charge being read over to Aim, he replied, ""Very well,"" and shortly afterwards said, ""I can disprove that by telling you where the things are; the things she is charging mo with stealing are all in the cloak room at Charing Cross Station""—I proceeded to search him—he took off his right boot and sock, and from the foot of the sock he took 24 £5 Bank of England notes—all the notes are new and they make up the rest of the numbers already given—I afterwards went to Charing Cross Railway Station of the S.E. Railway cloak room, where a ticket was handed to me by Sergeant Burch, who had been to the prisoner's lodging and found a tin box and black bag, which Mrs. Dacre has seen—she identified the property at Charing Cross as hers, most of which is mentioned in the was in the name of Ward.

Cross-examined. From inquiries we found that a porter had removed luggage from the Charing Cross Hotel to the cloak room in the name of Ward—we have been trying to find the porter—we were told the luggage was taken away on a cab.

ALBERT JOHANSEN (Re-examined by the prisoner.) Your luggage came on a truck—I do not know the man who brought it.

WILLIAM BURCH . On August 23rd I went to 1, Sherwood Street, Piccadilly, and found certain luggage in a room occupied by the prisoner; there were a wooden box and two portmanteaux, one light box, two hat boxes, a black Gladstone bag, and a kit bag—Mrs. Dacre identified some of it in separate boxes as that contained in her list—I also found seven certificates of character E. J. Dacre, John Dacre, and Ernest J. Dacre, from April, 1900, to 1904, one from A. M. Hilliary, photographer, of Mount Gambia, near Melbourne, Australia, as having given every satisfaction as manager and operator for six months, others as having held the positions of bar man, night porter, and boots at hotels in Australia.

Cross-examined. I also found a lease of premises at £10 to £12 in the Avenue, Melbourne, and an agreement for a shop in the photographic business.

The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that the prosecutrix had entrusted him with (the draft and other property as her agent, and she might hare had it back before had she not gone to the police, and that he was willing to sign an authority for it to be delivered up to her. Later COUNSEL informed the court that the prisoner had signed a document which was satisfactory to the prosecution. The court held that as there was no proof that the Married Women's Property Act ever took effect in Melbourne the presumption was that the Common Law took effect in that Colony, and therefore in this case there was no legal defrauding of the wife.

Deception,"JOSEPH EATON . I am a licensed porter in the Central Meat Market, Smithfield—in the early morning of November 4th, the prisoner, whom I know well by sight, came up to me in the market and said, ""Are you doing anything?"" I said, ""No""—he said, ""Do you mind doing me a round?"" and I said, ""No""—he said, ""Go and get two pigs out of Keevil & Weston's, in the name of Cotton""—I went there and Moses Bernard gave me two dead pigs—I came outside the shop, and seeing the prisoner. I said, ""Where are you going to have these two pigs?""—he said, ""Follow me, and I will show you""—he took me to Eastman's cold air store—there was a large truck outside, and he told me to put them down there, which I did—he then gave me 3d., and I went to where I generally work—I was arrested for having obtained the pigs by false pretences; I was remanded first and eventually discharged.

Cross-examined. The reason that I recollect that morning so well is that I was taken to the Snow Hill police station on the Tuesday morning after, in consequence of what happened—I do not suggest that the prisoner told me that the pigs were his.

CHARLES WRIGHT . I live at 1. Clifton Terrace, Finsbury Park, and am in the employ of Edward Cornell, meat carrier—between 8 and 9 a.m. on November 4th I saw two dead pigs on a truck outside Eastman's—I saw Eaton outside there, but I did not see him do anything—I saw the prisoner take the pigs off the truck, and go away—I do not know where to.

By the COURT. This was about 7 a.m.—I do not think it could be seen from outside that anybody was buying pigs-Eaton came in about 8.15 and Cotton came in again about ten minutes after.

I reside at 117, Jubilee Street, Mile End, where my husband keeps a grocer's shop—I remember Corrin coming and asking for 1d. worth of tea—I do not keep 1d. packets, and served him with a 2d. packet like this, marked ""Paquet ""tea—he handed me a new shilling—I gave him seven coppers and a threepenny bit in change, but he refused the threepenny bit, and I gave him the whole 10d. in coppers—I put the shilling and the threepenny bit in the till, where there were a half-crown and two shillings—the policeman came and I showed him the till, where I found the bad shilling produced, and which the officer did something to.

FRANK GIRDLER (Detective Sergeant H.) I went with Izzard to Grobofsky's shop on December 28th about 8 p.m.—she turned out the till which contained a half-crown, a threepenny piece, and two shillings, one counterfeit—I marked the coin ""F G 1,"" my initials—this bad shilling was handed to me by Sergeant Robinson, and has been in my possession ever since.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER . I am Inspector of coin to His Majesty's Mint—these two shillings are counterfeit, and of the same mould.

The prisoner, in his defence, said he gave the coins to Corrin who did not know what they were.

GUILTY .

He then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction at this Court in April, 1898, of feloniously uttering counterfeit coin. Eleven other convictions were proved against him. Five years' penal servitude."
Theft,"HENRIK KILLGREN . I am a medical practitioner, living at 49, Eaton Square—Wobeke was in my employment as butler—he left last June—during September, October and December I missed articles from my house—on December 16th I missed a silver medal and a cheque for £5 5s.—this is the cheque.

THOMAS KING (Detective). I arrested Bugel at 28, Percy Street, a common lodging house—I told him I was a police officer and should take him into custody for being concerned with others in stealing and receiving a quantity of articles, also a cheque for £5 5e.—he said, ""I had the cheque and, being afraid to change it myself, I gave it to Porges, whom you know quite well, but I had nothing out of it; the violin and

medal I took to Whitechapel with the 'Little Saxon'; he loft me in Leman Street, and after being absent for about fifteen minutes he returned with 7s.: all I had out of that was a few drinks""—I went to find Porges, but he had left—I could find no trace of him—my information is he has gone to Paris.

Cross-examined. Bugel did not try to put me off the scent by saying ""Perkins"" instead of ""Porges""—he told me at once what he knew of the matter—he told me he had been in England eight months and was teaching the French language—that is correct.

Bugel's statement before the Magistrate: ""I don't know the man who stole the things; I have never spoken to him. The first time I spoke to him was when I was arrested, and that was the tint time I heard anything of any theft. Lander gave me one morning a cheque, but said nothing of any theft. He said he could have cashed the cheque himself if he were not dressed so shabbily; could I give the cheque to anyone who could cash it? I brought it (the cheque) to Porges. That was the last I ever saw of the cheque, nor did I receive any money.""

Bugel, in his defence on oath, said that he got his living by teaching French, that Lander asked him to cash the cheque, laying he had got it from Dr. Killgren: that he tried to do so; that the medal was given to him to sell, and then was handed to the ""Little Saxon""; and that he never knew the things were stolen.

NOT GUILTY .

WOBEKE and LANDER— Twelve months hard labour each."
Theft,"JOHN HENRY FRANCIS . I am a waste paper and metal merchant, of 27, Huggin Lane, E.C.—I have a lot of waste leather cuttings at times, which I am in the habit of selling to a Mr. Robinson at £9 per ton or 9s. 4d. per cwt.—having some cuttings to sell, I wrote to him a few weeks ago at 13, Bastwick Street and my letter was returned to me by the Post Office ""Not known""—I then went to a house in Bastwick Street, where I saw a man named Robinson, but not the Robertson who dealt with me, and he referred me to 59, Bastwick Street, where I saw a man named Sellwood, whom my partner knew, but whom I had never seen before—I gave him my card—some days afterwards I found that Robinson, the man with whom I dealt, had removed to Bethnal Green—I went there and saw him with reference to my cuttings and he said he would call for them on the Saturday or the first thing on Monday morning—about 4 p.m. on February 24th, the Friday before this Saturday, I found that these cuttings of mine, which were worth two guineas to me, were gone, and I did not know who took them—I immediately went to see Robinson—at the time I saw Sellwood his wife and a young woman, whom I have since found was Yoxall's wife, were present—I traced the cuttings, and identified them at Mr. Lyons' shop.

PERCY FRANCIS WINTER . I am Mr. Francis' partner—on Friday, February 24th, a little after 2 p.m., a man came to the shop and asked for some cuttings, saying he came from Robinson—I said he could have

them, and he then said he would come back with another man—I was expecting somebody to come from Robinson to clear the cuttings—he then came back with Castle and said that their guvn'or told them that if there were half a ton of the stuff they were to allow me more, and the fair man, who was the first one that had called, said he could not allow me the money because there was not the quantity—Castle then turned round and said, ""Oh, give them 6s.""—they did not actually give me any money—it was Mr. Robinson's custom to give me the money before he took the goods away—they both said they came from Robinson—they then drove off in a one-horse van with the goods—Mr. Francis came in shortly afterwards, and I told him what had happened.

By the COURT. The first man that came was neither of the prisoners—he said he would come back with a van—the first man said that as there was not half a ton he could not allow me 6s. but only 5s. 6d., whereupon Castle said, ""Oh, give them 6s. We will make that all right when we get home.""

Cross-examined by Castle. I cannot say if you were there when the first man was actually signing the receipt for the goods, but you were there when it was being made out.

Re-examined. They gave me a receipt, which I have left with the Court—it was written out and signed by the first man, who signed himself as ""Arthur Cunningham""—the value of the goods was two guineas.

WILLIAM ROBINSON . I am a leather dealer, of 78, Sclater Street, Brick Lane—seven months ago I lived at 13, Bastwick Street—I was in the habit of buying leather cuttings from Francis and I had agreed to send for some either on the Saturday or Monday at the end of last month—Francis came to me on February 24th to know if I were going to clear the cuttings—I said I could not clear them till Saturday or Monday the next week, and he said, ""Do not make it any later than that""—he afterwards came to me and said, ""You have not had the cuttings, have you?"" and I said, ""No, I cannot clear them till Monday""—""Well,"" he says, ""somebody has cleared them in your name""—I had not authorised either of the prisoners, or anybody else to fetch those cuttings—Yoxall has been working for me on and off for two years, and has been in the habit of clearing cuttings for me, as also has his father-in-law, Sellwood—when Francis came to me on the 24th he asked me if there were any chance of tracing the cuttings, and I said I was sure there was as it appeared to me to have been done by somebody who worked for me, and who knew the places where I took the cuttings to—I then went with him to the principal people that I was in the habit of taking my goods to, and after trying two or three places we got into Brick Lane, where we told two policemen at the corner the circumstances of the case and asked them if they had seen a van pull up there—they said they had not—we then went to Mrs. Smith's shop, a leather dealer in Brick Lane, and I showed her a sample of my leather cuttings, and asked her if she had been offered a parcel of such goods—she said she had, and these cuttings were going to be brought in half an hour—we told the policeman that—as soon as the van pulled up about 5.45 p.m., Yoxall and another man, whom I did not know, went

into the shop and were then taken into custody and taken to the station—I was asked by the policeman if I knew who the man was that was showing the article in the shop, Castle, but I did not know him; neither did I know the carman, but I knew Yoxall as working for me—Francis identified the cuttings.

Cross-examined by Yoxall. You went to Francis on many occasions for cuttings for me, and so did your father-in-law—I cannot say the last occasion on which you went—you have been with me to sell cuttings to Mrs. Smith—you took charge of my pony and van whilst I was in the shop, if you did not go inside.

By the COURT. It was not my pony and van that I saw at Brick Lane.

RECECCA LYONS . I am the wife of Albert Lyons and trade at 227, Brick Lane, in the name of ""R. Smith"" as a leather dealer—about 5.40 p.m., on February 24th, the prisoners, whom I have never seen before, came and showed me a little sample of a leather cutting, and asked me if I would buy some, but they asked such a high price that I could not buy them—no deal took place, and they were getting into a van outside when two policemen came up—the next morning I picked up a leather cutting in the passage, which might have been mine or might have been somebody else's, as the best part of my stock is this kind of stuff—I showed it to the policemen—the prisoners did not say where they had got the cuttings from.

By the COURT. They both showed me two pieces of leather; it might have been three—they both of them spoke to me—as soon as the policemen came up I saw there was a van outside.

WILLIAM TILLEY (25 H.R.) About 5.15 p.m., on February 24th, I was on duty in Virginia Road, Bethnal Green, with another constable, when Francis came up to me and said he had lost a van load of leather cuttings—I said, ""Where have you lost them from?""—he said, ""Huggin Lane, City""—I asked him if he could give me a description of the van, or anything, and he said, ""No,"" and I then advised him to go to the police station—I went to Brick Lane, and kept observation on No. 277—about 5.45 p.m. a van drove up and two men jumped out and went into No. 277—I went up to the carman and told him to get down; I then said to them all, ""Consider yourselves in custody""—shortly afterwards Robinson and Francis came up, and Mr. Francis said, pointing to Castle, ""That is my man. I will charge him""—the men were taken to Commercial Street station, where they were detained—on the way to the station Castle said, ""I employed those two men. They cannot know anything about it. I am employed by a fair-haired man,"" meaning the driver—I went back for the driver, but could not find him, but he was eventually taken to Cloak Lane police station—he was not charged, as I had not sufficient evidence to connect him with it—I am quite certain that Yoxall was the man who took the sample in.

ROBERT HODGES (Detective, City). On Friday, February 24th, at 9 p.m., I was at Cloak Lane police station when the prisoners were brought in—after being cautioned, Castle said, in reply to the charge, ""All I have to say is, this man,"" meaning Yoxall,"" is innocent of anything at all. I

called round at his house to give him a couple of hours' work when he came with me to Brick Lane on the van.""

JOSEPH EVANS . I am a carman and contractor, of 2, President Place, where I work with my father, I managing the vans, and he the wood—on February 24th Castle and another man came to me and said they wanted a van to go to Huggin Lane, City, to get some leather cuttings, and from there to go to Brick Lane—I went with them in a van to Huggin Lane, I driving—on reaching there I looked after the van, and did not see them going into a shop—they then came up with some sacks on a trolley and put them on the van—Castle said to me, ""Drive to St. Martin's Lane""—on getting there we waited about a quarter of an hour for a pal whom Castle said he was expecting—on the pal not turning up Castle said, ""Drive me to Gee Street""—on getting to Gee Street I pulled up at the corner of Golden Lane as it was such a narrow thoroughfare—I went to a coffee shop to have some tea while Castle went to try and find his pal—he came back and said he had left a note for him, saying that he would either be at the coffee shop or at Brick Lane—he went away again and brought back Yoxall—it was then 6.30 p.m., and as I had something else to do I asked another carman to take Castle and Yoxall to Brick Lane—I know Castle from having done one job for him before—it was he who paid me.

Cross-examined by Castle. I helped you to load up the last sack—I am certain you said pal and not guv'nor—there is not room for two vans in Gee Street.

Re-examined. Gee Street is the next turning to Bastwick Street—I have only been down there a few times.

Castle's statement before the Magistrate: ""I should like you to read this statement to show you that I am an innocent man. I am being punished for the guilt of another man who the police are now searching for; if he is not found, the police tell me, I shall have to suffer for the lot. This man employed me to do odd jobs for him from the City to any place he might tell me to go. On Friday, February 24th, he came round to the place I was stopping at, and told me he had a load of goods coming home from the City, but I would have to get a van. I gets the van, and he tells the carman to drive to Huggin Lane, City; when we get there he tells me to take the weight of the stuff as the man weighs it off. I did so, and after we had loaded up he tells me I need not wait for him, but to go off and have some tea and meet him at Smith's, of Brick Lane, about 5.30. On the way home the carman tells me he will have to go home and get another carman to take the van as he has his own regular job to do at six o'clock. While the carman is having his tea, I leave the van under his care while I go to a friend of mine to ask him to come and give me a help to unload when we got to Brick Lane. On our arrival at Smith's, of Brick Lane, me and my friend jumps down and goes in smith thinking to find my employer there, but he had not come yet. On going out of the shop we was stopped by two constables, who asked us Whether we was in charge of cuttings what was in the van, and I answered ""Yes,"" The constable then told me he would have to take me in charge as the goods had been

stolen, and we was both taken to the station and charged with being concerned with a man, not in custody, of obtaining or stealing goods by means of a trick. The man Yoxall did not even know where the goods had come from, but merely came for a ride with me, thinking to earn something by helping me to unload. All I have stated here I swear, by my Heavenly Father, is the truth, and nothing but the truth.""

Yoxall's statement before the Magistrate: ""About five o'clock last Friday this man asked me to do a couple of hours' work. I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'Come for a ride as far as Brick Lane in a van.' When I got there I was coming out of the door, when two constables came in. When these people went for the cuttings I was having dinner with my wife.""

Castle: ""That is all I have to say.""

Yoxall, in his defence on oath, said that Castle, whom he had known for seven or eight years, came and asked him to do a couple of hours' work for him; that he went with him and another man, whom he did not know, to Mrs. Smith's shop, in Brick Lane, where he was arrested; that he did not know where the cuttings came from, nor for what reason they were taken to Brick Lane, that he did not ask Mrs. Smith to buy any; that he had never been to the shop before with Robinson, but that he thought it was another Mrs. Smith, of Brick Lane that he had gone to; that he had worked for a man named Roberts, a waste paper dealer, with a barrow, sometimes two or three times a week; and that he did not know whether Roberts was in partnership with Castle or not.

Evidence in Reply.

WILLIAM ROBINSON (Re-examined). I have been with Yoxall to this shop of Mrs. Lyons—it was formerly occupied by Mrs. Smith, who has now gone lower down Brick Lane.

CASTLE GUILTY . YOXALL NOT GUILTY . CASTLE then pleaded GUILTY to a conviction of felony at North London Sessions on May 13th, 1902, in the name of Edward Franklin. Eight previous convictions were proved against him. He received a bad character from the police. Eighteen months' hard labour."
Royal Offences,"MICHEL DINERSTEIN . I carry on business as a money exchanger at 13, Brick Lane, Spitalfields—on 'March 22nd I was with my father in the office when at 8.45 p.m. the prisoner came in and put these five roubles (Produced) on the table and asked my father to exchange them for 2s. each—the price is 1s. 11d., and we offered him 1s. 10d.—we looked at the coins and on examination we found them to be lighter than they ought to have been, and that they were bad—we sent for a policeman and when he came we told him that two mens had been in on the Saturday and exchanged three bad coins—we told him that the roubles were bad after the policeman had come, and he said that it was good money—we asked him where he had got them from, and he said they were given to him by a man who had left London—we wanted to lock him up and he said to my father, ""You have not lost hundreds of pounds; you have only lost 6s. I will give you back the 6s. and you let me go""—he showed us 6s., but my father would not take it—the policeman took the roubles from his hands—when he offered us the 6s. we had not said anything about the amount of the coins that had been exchanged on the Saturday before.

Cross-examined. My father and I were standing together, and he put the roubles in front of us—Russian roubles are made of silver—my father looked at them and then offered him 1s. 10d.—I have been in the money exchanging business about five months—I have recently come from Russia—I was not a money changer there—my father has been in London nine years, but he has been a money changer only eight months—we offered him 1s. 10d. only to keep him waiting for a minute—I was not in the office when the two mens came in the Saturday before, and my father is not sure that the prisoner was one of them—my father was not at the Police Court—it was after we told him about that that he paid, ""You have not lost hundreds of pounds""—one rouble was lying on the table, and the other four the policeman took from his hands.

Re-examined. We knew the coins were bad when we offered him 1s. 10d.—it was only to get time to bring in an officer that we bargained with him.

By the COURT. We did not Say that we had lost 6s. over it on the Saturday before; we told him we had lost money by exchanging for bad money.

DAVIS DINERSTEIN (Interpreted). I am a money changer—on the night of March 22nd I was in the office with my son when the prisoner came in—I spoke to him myself—the conversation was carried on in Yiddish—he put the roubles on the counter—I offered him 1s. 10d. which is below the exchanged price, because I saw they were bad, and I wanted to gain time to call a policeman—when somebody went for a Policeman I asked him where he had got the money from, and he said, This is my money""—I told him it was bad money, and asked him where he had got it, and he said from somebody who had left England—I told him that I had been cheated once before with bad roubles on the Saturday evening—then the policeman came in, and asked me what I had lost—then the prisoner said, ""You have not lost hundreds of pounds only 6s., and I will repay you""—he wanted to pay me 6s., counting the money out in the policeman's presence but I did not take it—I did not mention the amount; I simply said I had been cheated on the Saturday before.

By the COURT. Various people pay different sums for roubles—cook & Son pay 1s. 10d. and we pay 1s. 11d.—paper roubles pass current for 2s. 1d., but silver roubles have more value.

Cross-examined. I did not give an answer when the policeman asked me what the loss was—the prisoner did not ask me that—I said I should lose by this bad money being passed on me—I did not tell the policeman ""I had three like these passed to me last Saturday""—I was not at the Police Court.

EDWARD BELL (317 H.) About 9 p.m. on March 22nd I was called to the office of Mr. Dinerstein—I went there and saw the prisoner—Mr. Dinerstein showed me these five counterfeit roubles (Produced), which I afterwards marked in his presence—I can see my marks now—I searched the prisoner in Mr. Dinerstein's office, and I found 5s. 6d. in English money, 11d. in coppers, and a groschen, a small Russian coin—I took him to the station, where the charge was interpreted to him—the interpreter is not here—when seeing Mr. Dinerstein in his office I did not notice anybody waiting outside—Michel Dinerstein was present when the prisoner was charged, and he could hear all that was said.

Cross-examined. There are a lot of people in Brick Lane—there were people walking by the shop.

MICHEL DINERSTEIN (Re-examined). I was present when the prisoner was charged—my father did not go with me—I preferred the charge—I heard the charge of attempting to change bad money interperted to him, and he said at first that he was very sorry and did not know the man who gave him the money, but afterwards he said to the interpreter, ""I am very sorry; I have been in another exchange office, and the man told me it is bad roubles, and I should not change them, but I did not listen to him.""

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER . I am Inspector of Coins to His majesty's Mint—these are five counterfeit coins of base metal, representing silver Russian roubles of the present Czar—they are very well made.

Cross-examined. They would not deceive me simply on account of their weight.

The prisoner, in his defence, on oath, said that while coming home from work he met a countryman of his, who asked him to change the roubles at 2s. a time, because he being a ""greener"" could get more for them than his friend, who had been some time in London; that in changing them he did not know they were bad; that Mr. Dinerstein had told him to refund him 6s. of which he had been defrauded the Saturday before; that he had not been to another money changing office that day, nor had he told the interpreter so; and that he did not say that the man from whom he had the money had left London. He received a good character whilst in England.

GUILTY . Four months hard labour."
Theft,"ADA WOOD . I am a domestic servant and reside at 44, Peel Street, Notting Hill—I first went there about three months ago—the owner is Mr. Woolford and I rented a room there—another young woman lodged with me—I first met the prisoner when I was waiting in the street for my young man, and he came up and spoke to me—there was a coffee stall near—there were other people standing there who knew him and he told them and me that he was a detective—he said I had not better hang round there as the fellows at the stall was no good—I said I was not waiting for anything, I was waiting for my young man—he said he knew all the

men and could take them all and lock them up if he liked—all along he said he was a detective—I used to see him there nearly every night when I was waiting for my young man—when he said he was a detective I said I did not know anything about detectives and he showed me a police whistle and the handcuffs that he had, and I thought he was a detective I—on February 27th he came to my house and asked to see me—I asked him up to my room—I had not asked him to come to the house and did not know he was coming—he said he was a detective and had come to raid my house for my having gentlemen to see me, and that if I did not square him he would lock me up—I asked him what he wanted in order to be squared—he said, ""Money""—I said, ""How much do you want: will 10s. do?""—he said, ""Yes""—I gave him 10s. because I thought there would be a row in the house—I believed at that time that he was a detective, but I did not believe he could lock me up, because I had not done anything to be locked up for—when I gave him the 10s. he said he would say no more about it and he left the place—he did not come again—I saw him one or two nights afterwards—he has often called after me in the streets, but I took no notice of him—when he came to my house he said he had been watching the house for a long time.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. I was not the worse for drink on the night you were arrested—I was not with two gentlemen whom I was going to take home—you told a constable to arrest me because I was drunk and the constable said he would take you instead—I gave you the money because I was afraid my young man would come up and that there would be a row—I was not kissing a bookmaker round the corner when you first saw me—at the Court below you said I was kissing half-a-dozen fellows.

Re-examined. He first made the accusation against me of being drunk a week or two afterwards.

WALTER HAMBROOK (Detective F.) I have known the prisoner for some time—one night early in March I met him in Portobello Road and he said, ""I can tell you where you can get half a quid easily; you go to 44 Peel Street; there are two tarts living there and you can get it at once""—I arrested him on the evening of April 6th—on the remand the charge of obtaining money by menaces was made against him—when I told him the charge he replied, ""It is a lie""—I found on him four keys, one skeleton and a police whistle—he has never been connected with the police force.

Cross-examined. I did not know anything about the charge when it was reported to me in March—I did not send another officer to arrest you—I and the sergeant were, keeping observation on you—I went to make inquiries and while I was doing so the other officer arrested you as you came out of one of the places.

HAROLD WOOLFORD . I live at 44, Peel Street, Notting Hill, and am the landlord—Ada Wood has been lodging there for about nine months—there is no ground for the imputation that she is living an unchaste life there to my knowledge—I have known the prisoner for about two year—on Saturday, March 11th, in High Street, Notting Hill, he spoke

to me about Ada Wood—he asked me whether I was aware that Ada was taking men home at night—I said no, I was not aware of it, and added, ""All I can do is to watch for it and the first man I can catch will go down I the stairs or through the window""—the first man I found was him—I done no more than I told him I should do, and he went down the stairs—he said he could get half a dollar or a quid out of the young lady when he liked, and he said he had had it—he said he was a butcher and I knew that.

GUILTY . He then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction of felony at Clerkenwell Sessions on June 14th, 1904. The police stated that the prisoner preyed upon unfortunates and was a most dangerous man. Twelve months' hard labour."
Theft,"DAVID MACKENZIE RUSSELL . I live at East Lodge, West Ham Park and am a park superintendent under the City Corporation—on November 2nd the prisoner came and asked me if I could lend him a saw for half an hour, as, he said, he could earn half a dollar—I said I did not know him—he said, ""Walter Lilley there knows me""—Lilley said, ""Yea, I know him, but I don't know much of him""—I lent him the saw—he said he would bring it back in the afternoon, as I told him to do—it was not brought back—I next saw him, I think, on April 17th—I had previously given information to the police.

JOHN WILKINSON . I live at 12, Adamson Road, Customs House, and am a joiner—on November 2nd I was employed by the City Corporation—by instructions I handed the prisoner a saw—he promised to bring it back in two hours—it was never returned.

WALTER EDWIN BAKER . I live at 119, Woodgrange Road, Forest Gate, and am employed as a pawnbroker's assistant by Mr. Paul—on November 2nd this saw (Produced) was pawned with us in the name of John Warren for 1s. 6d.—I cannot remember that I took it in, but I know the prisoner as a customer of the shop—this is the ticket.

GEORGE SORIMSHAW (Detective-Sergeant K.) About 8.15 p.m. on April 15th I was in West Ham Lane, when I saw the prisoner—I said to him, ""Bill, I want you for stealing a saw at West Ham Park on November 2nd last""—he said, ""That is right, George. I had it; I pawned it with Paul's in the Woodgrange Road, in the name of Warren, for la. 6d.""—I took him to the police station—whilst being detained for inquiries he said, ""Go on, get on with it; I have told you quite sufficient. Put me in the nick; three months will do for me this time""—he was charged and made no reply.

The prisoner, in his defence, stated that he earned a few shillings with the saw, but did not get paid, and as he was without money he pawned it with the intention of redeeming it next day.

GUILTY . He then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction of felony at West Ham on May 20th, 1899. Three other conviction were proved against him. He was given a bad character by the police. Two months' hard labour."
Theft,"JOHN COMPTON . I am a clerk in the employment of the Post Office—before May this year there were a number of complaints of letters being; missed which passed through the South Western Post Office—I was asked to investigate the matter, and on May 3rd I made up what is known as a test packet—it consisted of this gold ring (Produced), which has my private mark upon it—I placed it in a small chocolate box—I also put in the packet nine 1d. postage stamps, which I marked, and also a written communication—the whole I put into a very stout envelope, which I fastened down very carefully, but not with sealing wax—I addressed it to A. J. Cowley, Esq., Ringwood, Ranelagh Gardens, London, S.W.—that was not an address upon the prisoner's rounds—I posted it at the South Western District Post Office about 12.45 that day—that is the post office where the prisoner is employed—I gave instructions as to what was to be done—the packet coming in the ordinary way under the prisoner's observation, should have been thrown out as a mis-sort; it was placed in his delivery—about 5.15 I saw him at the district office and told him 1 had been enquiring into the losses of packets, and I cautioned him—I said, ""You had a mis-sort packet on your walk to-day for Ranelagh Gardens; what did you do with it?""—he said, ""I remember the packet; I threw it out as a mis-sort""—I said, ""Do you mind turning out your pockets?""—he said, ""No,"" and produced from a pocket a small purse, at the bottom of which was the ring marked by me—I said, ""What have you done with the other contents

of the packet?""—he said, ""I have not seen them. I can account for my possession of the ring; I picked it up on the floor of the office. After I threw the packet out as a mis-sort, I picked the ring up""—the ring could not have come out, even if the packet had been opened, because it would not have come out of the chocolate box—it was a very tightly pressed box.

ALBERT EDWARD MITCHLEY . On May 3rd I received instructions from Mr. Compton, and in consequence I received at the South Western District Post Office a packet addressed to A. J. Cowley, Esq., Ringwood, Ranelagh Gardens, London, S.W., which I put on the prisoner's board; that is where the letters which he is going to take out on his next round would be—if a letter was put there with an address which is not included in his delivery, he should reject it—there is a rack in front of his board, where he should put mis-sorted letters, and there is a clerk who takes them away—I did not see him go out on this morning, nor did I see on his board any letter as a mis-sort—I did not see this packet where it should have been.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. Mis-sorted letters are sometimes put on the table—it frequently happens that men leave letters behind them which they endorse.

Re-examined. On this occasion I searched everywhere to see if there was a letter.

By the COURT. I was specially observing the prisoner on this day—I especially looked in every place which is usually used for mis-sorted letters, to see if there was one, but I did not find one.

FRANK AUGUSTUS ELSWORTHY . I am an overseer in the Post Office—I was on duty about 1 o'clock on May 3rd at the South Western District Post Office, where I saw the prisoner at his board—I had received instructions from Mitchley to keep an eye upon him—I called out to certain men to clear out their walks—the prisoner came and took this packet, I saw him put it to his ear and shake it, and I never saw it afterwards—if he had thrown out a packet as a mis-sort I should have seen it, and it would have come to the sorting table again—if anyone in the employment of the Post Office finds a ring, his duty is to hand it over to his overseer or some other responsible officer—on that day I should have been the officer—this (Produced) is the book in which everything found in this way is entered—the rule is well known among the employees that every thing that is found should be handed over.

ARTHUR DOWNES (Constable, G.P.O.) I arrested the prisoner on May 3rd—he said nothing.

The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate: ""I plead not guilty, and call no witnesses.""

The prisoner, in a written statement, said that he saw the packet addressed to an address which was not on his walk; that he placed it in the packet tray and went back to his table; that as he was starting on his walk he saw something shining on the floor, which he picked up and found to be a ring; that he put it in his pocket and meant to give it up; that he went on his walk, and when he returned he was going upstairs to tell the inspector that he had found

a ring which he had forgotten to give up, when the overseer told him he was wanted in the Postmaster's room; that he told the two gentlemen there that he had seen the packet, and told them that he had sorted it; that when he was searched the ring was found in his purse, and that he had not seen the chocolate box and the stamps.

GUILTY . Strongly recommended to mercy by the Jury. Eight months' hard labour."
Theft,"SOLOMON GOLDSTEIN . I am a cycle manufacturer, carrying on business in Whitechapel Yard—John Goldstein came to me and hired a bicycle on March 7th—I next saw it on May 14th in Club Row—alterations had been made to it—Goldstein said it belonged to his brother-inlaw, Shoolman, who said the bicycle belonged to him—Goldstein was charged—my name was on the bicycle.

Cross-examined. It is easy to alter the appearance of a bicycle; that is why I put my name upon it—the saddle was not mine, nor the handle bars, nor the brake—the mudguard had been altered—when I saw Shoolman he said the bicycle was his—I showed him my name on it—the moment he saw the name he said, ""The bicycle is not mine.""

FREDERICK GOODING (Detective H.) On May 14th the prosecutor came to the police station with John Goldstein—I told him I was a police officer and was making inquiries about the bicycle—John Goldstein said the bicycle was his; he could prove it by a dozen persons—he said, ""I bought it in Club Row""—I showed him the name—he said, ""It is my bicycle.""

Cross-examined. I know the handle and saddle does not belong to the prosecutor—I mentioned this before the Magistrate; he cut a lot of it out—I did not have a row at the police station—I did not have a drink

with Shoolman—I paid for my own refreshment—Sergeant Watson issued the warrant for his apprehension—I told the Magistrate I had seen Shoolman in Court on Tuesday—he told me he had a bicycle of his own.

Re-examined. This prosecution was instituted at the instigation of the Magistrate.

BENJAMIN SEESON (Detective H.) I arrested the prisoner on May 17th at his house, on a charge of receiving—in answer to the charge he said, ""I wish I had nothing to do with it, but I can easily get out of it""—he is a thoroughly respectable man—there is not a word against him—I could always have found him when I wanted him.

NOT GUILTY . GOLDSTEIN Discharged on recognisances."
Breaking Peace,"JOHN THEODORE WHITE . I live at 40, Anne Street, New North Road, City, and am a painter—I recollect meeting the prisoner on May 7th about 10.30 p.m.—I saw him waiting at the corner of the street—he said, ""I want to speak to you for a moment""—I said, ""All right,"" and walked down a street by the side of a public-house—he said, ""I hear you were with two 'd's' (meaning detectives) the other day,"" and before I had time to answer he struck at me on the right side of my face—I closed with him, and as I did so another man came up, and punched me from behind—I broke away from the prisoner, and ran after the other man, and the prisoner tripped me up, and kicked me in the privates, and on the knee—after that I managed to get up against a ladder by the side of a building—I could not get away from there, because I was surrounded by thirty or forty people—I saw the prisoner pull out a revolver, and hold it straight at me, and fire at me""—I ran round the corner into New Street, into New Inn Yard, and got on to a 'bus with them at my heels—I am positive it was a revolver—I told the conductor to drive on—five people jumped on at the back, on the footboard—it was not the prisoner, but the one who struck me from behind, who was with the others on the footboard—I. told the conductor to stop outside Kingsley Road police station, and told the inspector there what had happened—he told me to see the Magistrate next morning.

Cross-examined. I say the prisoner fired the revolver at me pointing it straight at me—I saw it fired—I did not see any smoke at all—directly I saw the revolver and heard the report I made off—when I got on to the 'bus the prisoner was following with the others, but he did not actually get on to the bus—this took place at the crossing of Anne Street, where the road runs through—there would be no business being done at this time of night, and, with the exception of the public-houses there would be no lights, it being Sunday—there were, about thirty or forty of them, and it was all an arranged affair—they met together to assault me, because they accused me of giving information to the police—I admit I have been in trouble, and since then they seem to bear me a grudge—it was not the prisoner only who desired to do me an injury—I had not said anything to the prisoner when he came up—I had seen him about four or five times during the last week—I knew there was a policeman on point duty near by, and the reason I did not go to him was because the crowd were in front of me, and I should have to rush into the whole lot of them to get to him—I cried for help, and I know for a fact that stolen things are got rid of in the public-house—I was struck in the side of my face, on the knee, and in the privates—I was not knocked silly—I got away the best I could—I had to run sixty or seventy yards to the 'bus—I gave information to the inspector the same night.

Re-examined. The lamps were lighted in the street—I do not think they had put them out—I saw the revolver pointed at me—I did not want to

be shot at, or to notice if there was any smoke, but made off directly I heard the report.

RANDALL HODSON (Sergeant G.) On May 5th I was with Sergeant Fuller in Whitmoore Road, where I saw the prosecutor—I did not see any of this struggle—I saw the prisoner at 1, Grove Walk, Hoxton, in bed, asleep—I woke him and said, ""Nichollson, I want you for shooting at Jack White in Shoreditch last Sunday""—he said, ""Do you think I should shoot such a b—s—pot as him""—I read the warrant to him—I then took him in custody to the King's Road police station, where he was charged.

Cross-examined. He made no statement denying the charge.

The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he saw the prosecutor in High Street, Shoreditch, on May 7th, but neither spoke to nor interfered with him; that there was no grievance between them; that he had never had a revolver in his possession in his life; that it was a got up affair; that the only explanation that occurred to him was that the prosecutor had been living apart from his wife for three or four weeks, and that he (the prisoner) had been in Shoreditch with her and had a drink with her, and perhaps somebody had informed the prosecutor.

NOT GUILTY ."
Theft,"JOSEPH GEORGE STEVENS . I am a clerk in the Secretary's Office of the General Post Office—in consequence of information that had come to my knowledge I made inquiries as to the non-delivery of letters that had passed through the St. John's Wood Office—I made up a packet identical in shape and size to this (Produced) and addressed it to ""Mr. J. Hamilton, care of Mrs. Bush, 21, Townsend Road, St. John's Wood, N.W.'*—I put in it one sovereign, one half-sovereign, one half-crown, two separate shillings, a sixpence, and two penny stamps—this is the sixpence that I put in (Produced)—I marked it with a die ""S.R.,"" and before I put it in the packet I noticed it was a bent one as this one is—it was also discoloured, but the discoloration has disappeared with friction—I posted the packet at 3.30 p.m. at the General Post Office, and in the ordinary course it would arrive at the St. John's Wood Post Office just before 8.30 p.m., where the prisoner's duties were—about 11 p.m. the same day I was shown this sixpence—on June 16th I saw the prisoner at the Post Office, Clifton Road, Maida Vale—after telling him who I was I said, ""Last night you took out for delivery a packet addressed to Mr. J. Hamilton, care of Mrs. Bush, 21, Townsend Road, St. John's Wood, N.W. You did not deliver it. Have you any explanation to offer?""—he said, ""I beg to state that before going out on my

delivery I put the packet in my bag. The bag has a hole in it, I lost the packet. I looked for it in the Townsend Road, but could not find it I went back along the road and looked for it""—I then said, ""After completing your delivery you went to your father's house and from there to the Ordnance Arms, where you changed this sixpence,"" and I produced this sixpence to him, and said, ""I identify this coin as one which I enclosed yesterday in the packet I addressed to Mr. Hamilton. The packet contained coins to the value of £1 15s. and two penny stamps, and they all bear my private mark""—he said, ""I went there and changed a sixpence. I never had the other money. I am willing to be searched, and my house as well. I lost the packet""—I said, ""You were seen to change this sixpence, and it was placed in the cash register. No other sixpence was placed in the register before it was examined, and after the one you changed was placed there""—he said, ""The sixpence I changed was mine. You can search me and my house""—I gave instructtions that the prisoner's bag should be taken from his house, and later in the day I saw him at the General Post Office, and, showing him the bag, said, ""When you went to the address of the packet after you had finished your delivery, you said you had lost the packet through the hole in this bag. Had it been there long?""—he said, ""Yes, some time; my keys wore it, ""meaning the keys he took out—I said, ""You knew it was there when you say you put the packet in?""—he said, ""Yes, but I did not think it was big enough to let anything through""—this packet was at the time in the corner of the bag, and I said, ""There is a packet in the bag now. Would that drop through the hole?""—he said, ""No, it is too large""—I said, ""It is identical in shape and size with the one you had last night""—he said, ""I thought that was smaller""—the hole was not nearly large enough to let the packet through.

WILLIAM JOHN VIOLET . I am an overseer at the Eastern Central District Post Office—I remember clearing a packet out of the letter box of the General Post Office—I placed it in the bag for dispatch at 7.10 p.m. for the delivery at St. John's Wood Road Post Office—I saw the bag off—the packet was delivered that night.

GEORGE MARTIN . I am an overseer at the St. John's Wood Post Office—the prisoner was on duty there on June 15th ac 7.15 p.m., and it was part of his duty to clear the letters for the 8.30 delivery—I had received certain instructions about a packet, similar to this (Produced), addressed to 21, Townsend Road, which was expected—it arrived at the office about 8.2 p.m., and I put it down at the prisoner's seat among some other letters for him to deliver—I kept my eye on him till he went out on his round—when he went out I noticed he had the package in his hand, not in his bag.

RICHARD WALTER DAVIS . I am an assistant in the Confidential Inquiry Branch of the General Post Office—I received certain instructions as to the prisoner, in consequence of which on June 15th, in the evening, I kept him under observation—at 8.40 p.m. I saw him leave the St. John's Wood Post Office for his delivery—in his right hand he carried the test packet—at St. John's Wood Terrace he paused, looked at the packet, and

placed it in his inside pocket—shortly afterwards he began his delivery, and I saw him again at 9.45 p.m., when he went to his parents, home; at 10.25 p.m. he left there and went to the Ordnance Arms, where I saw him put on the counter the marked sixpence which was contained in the test packet and which I recognised as soon as I saw it—I did not lose sight of him until he had passed 21, Townsend Road, where he did not deliver the packet—I recognised the sixpence, as it was bent end disc louder—I acquainted Mr. Steven of what I had seen, and he instructed Roberts to make a search in the till.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. I could see the sixpence from where I stood; I could see right into the other bar—there is a partition between the bar you were standing in and mine, coming only nine inches over the counter, and then there is an opening—I was not four or five feet from you.

By the COURT. I could see quite distinctly what coin the prisoner put down.

WILLIAM ROBERTS (313 A.) I am attached to the General Post Office—in consequence of instructions received I kept the prisoner under observation on this evening, and saw him go to the Ordnance Arms, and then saw him leave again—after he left I examined the cash register in which I found this sixpence, which is marked ""S. R.""—I identified it, as I knew the mark—I was with Davis, and I know where he was standing in the public-house, and I also know the bar in which the prisoner was standing—Davis could see from one bar to the other—the counter is twenty inches wide, and the partition comes over nine inches of it, which leaves eleven inches for anybody to look over—I found the sixpence ten minutes after the prisoner had paid it.

Cross-examined. I saw no one else change a sixpence while you were there—I saw people go into the house, but I do not know what they changed.

The prisoner, in his defence, said that on reaching St. John's Wood Terrace he put the packet in his bag; that on reaching 21, Townsend Road, he felt for it, and found it had gone; that he looked up Townsend Road and St. John's Wood Terrace, but failed to find it; that on finishing his round he went to Mrs. Bush, and enquired for the gentleman to whom it was addressed, whom he found to be out; that he made an arrangement to call the next evening, when he would tell him what had happened; and that he changed a sixpence in the Ordnance Arms, but it was not the sixpence in the test packet.

JOSEPH GEORGE STEVENS (Re-examined by the JURY). I never mark two coins of the same date with the same marks—the dies were made specially for me, and nobody else used them.

By the COURT. I have a complete record of every coin I have marked during the last eighteen years—the date of this sixpence is 1893—I should say it was the last one I marked—it is the only 1893 sixpence I have ever marked—I should say it was four months before this since I marked another sixpence ""S. R.""

GUILTY . Nine months' hard labour."
Royal Offences,"ETHEL ROSINA LAYBOURN . I live at 11, Lingen Street, Bromley—by Bow—I have lived there since October, 1898—Linton has knocked at the door for the Potters upstairs, who have answered the door, and asked him upstairs—they had possession of the upper floor—Linton called on and off since Christmas, not before—he called every week, or two or three times a week—he went upstairs every time he came—he stayed about half an hour, never more than an hour—the police came in my place, and I afterwards pointed out Potter's room.

Cross-examined by Linton. On one occasion I answered the door, and said the Potters were out, but generally they came and asked you upstairs.

Re-examined. When Potter was at home Linton was asked upstairs.

STEPHEN CROOKSHANKS (Detective J.) Under the direction of Sergeant Pride, with other officers, I kept observation on Linton, as well as on Potter—on Thursday, May 4th, I saw Linton, who lives at 102, White-chapel Road, at a coffee house—when he left the coffee house he went to Valence Road, where he met Potter, who walked towards him from an opposite direction—they proceeded along Hanbury Street, through various turnings into Brick Lane, and together went into the Ship in Bacon Street, and stopped about three-quarters of an hour—Linton then went to the Weaver's Arms, Hoxton, Potter going towards Brick Lane—on May 9th I saw Linton leave his lodgings at 102, Whitechapel Road, and meet Potter in Valence Road—they walked together through some streets and entered the Ship—they remained there together about twenty minutes, then came out and separated—I followed Potter to High Street, Bromley, but owing to the neighbourhood I lost him—I next saw Linton on May 11th, leaving his lodgings—I and another officer followed him in the train—he got out at Bromley railway station, where Potter was waiting for him—both men went to Lingen Street;

Potter went in and stopped a few minutes, Linton left him, but they met again, took train to Whitechapel and visited the Ship—on May 18th I saw Linton leave his lodgings, go to Whitechapel railway station, take the train to Bromley, and from Bromley he went to 11, Lingen Street; where he entered and stayed half an hour, when he came out and took train to Whitechapel—he then went to the Weaver's Arms, Drysdale Street, Hoxton—I had other duties besides watching the prisoners, but I have seen them together about ten times—four times we followed them, and six times we followed Linton to Lingen Street—once he stayed outside, and five times he went in.

LINTON NOT GUILTY . (See last case.) Three years' penal servitude. POTTER— Eighteen months' hard labour."
Sexual Offences,"FREDERICK ALLEN . I live at 14, Chapel Grove, Exmouth Street—about nine years ago I was at the Strand Registry Office, and witnessed the marriage between the prisoner and his wife, whose maiden name was Talbot—she is still alive—I knew her—this is the certificate. [This was dated at the District Registry Office, Strand, July 19th, 1886]—those are the people I saw married referred to in the certificate.

WALTER SELBY (Sergeant G.) I have searched the records at Somerset House and produce copies of the certificates of marriage of the prisoner with Emily Elizabeth Talbot, on July 19th, 1886, and of his marriage with Mary Ann Pearse, on November 29th, 1899—I arrested him on June 2nd at 120, Farringdon Road—I said, ""Is your name John Howard Simpson?""—he said, ""Yes""—I said, ""I am a police officer, and I have seen a woman named Emily Elizabeth Simpson; she alleges that she is your wife, and that you have committed bigamy with a woman named Mary Ann Pearse""—he said, ""It is quite true""—I said, ""I shall arrest you for feloniously marrying Mary Ann Pearse on November 29th, 1899""—he said, ""I will give myself up at once for it""—when charged at the police station he made no reply.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. You gave yourself up for a bigamous marriage on July 29th, 1901, at Old Street police station—the report says that you entered the station the worse for drink and wished to give yourself up for bigamy—inquires were made, the necessary witnesses could not be found, and you were subsequently liberated.

JOHN EDWARD SIMPSON . I am the prisoner's son—about six years ago I went to the Castle public-house in New Cross Street to sell boot laces and etude—I saw my father and two other men—he said to me, ""Halloa, Johnny""—I said, ""Halloa, Dad""—he said, ""How is your mother?""—I said, ""All right, thank you; we only live round the corner, Dad""—he came outside the public-house, gave me 2d. and went into the railway station with the two other men—I went straight home and told my mother—I have not seen him since till now—I had seen him once

""before that, when mother came out of the smallpox hospital when he took me and mother to his granny's—I shall be nineteen years of age on December 21st—I went to school then, and came home, and when mother and I went for a walk we met him.

Cross-examined. I was about thirteen when I saw you at the public-house—it is not twelve years ago.

MARY ANN PEARSE . I live at 141, Carlyle Road, Manor Park—on November 29th, 1899,1 was married to the prisoner—this is the certificate—I have been living with him since—he has always been very good to me.

The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he was separated from his wife by a Magistrate's order eighteen months after the marriage; that he could not live with her in consequence of her prostitution and living with other men; that he had lost sight of her and believed from information he received that she was dead; that it was twelve or thirteen years ago when the boy who said he was his son recognised him; and that the allowances ordered of 12s. a week he had never paid to her.

JOHN EDWARD SIMPSON (Re-examined). Ten years ago we were living in Theobald's Road, Lamb's Conduit Street—mother was called Mrs. Simpson—she was living with a man named Russell in one room on the top floor—then she left him and lived with a man named Hipper in Aylesbury Street, Clerkenwell, in the same way as she lived with Russell, occupying the same room—she is still living with him—she was living with him when I saw the prisoner at the Castle public-house.

GUILTY , with a strong recommendation to mercy. He received a good character from the police. Discharged on his own recognisances."
Violent Theft,"DEWAR WATSON . I reside at Sudbury, near Harrow, and on June 26th, about 11 a.m., I was walking along High Street, Shadwell, and felt a man put his arms round my neck—there was the ordinary traffic about—then the man came to the front and snatched my chain away—I did not see his face then, but I turned round and followed him until he got to the Docks—I called out ""Police ""and a dock constable came out of the dock gates and ran up one street while I ran up another—I did not see the prisoner caught, as I lost sight of him for about a minute—I next saw him when a policeman was handing him from the roof of a house into a livery stable yard—I lost my chain, but a little girl picked up the bar—my watch was left in my pocket—I was not injured.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. I had a good look at your face after you got to the cottage—I did not see you when you actually snatched the chain.

WILLIAM LUMMING (Dock Constable.) I was on duty on June 26th at the Docks—I saw the prisoner running and followed by the prosecutor—he ran up Artichoke Hill, across High Street and Princes Square—I immediately gave chase, keeping him in view all the time—he entered an empty house; I believe he got in by means of a piece of string attached to the latch—he shut the door and I blew my whistle for assistance—Reed came up and went to the next house and, scaling the wall, caught the prisoner lying down—I was guarding the front of the house—I saw the prisoner afterwards at the back of the empty house in the yard—he seemed exhausted—he was taken to Leman Street station and charged—he did not say anything.

RICHARD REED (117 H.) On June 26th I was on duty in St. George's Street shortly before noon—I saw a crowd running—I gave chase after the prisoner—I saw him go into Princes Square and then into Mayfield Buildings—the prosecutor complained to me—after the prisoner had run into No. 15 he closed the door behind him, which made it impossible for me to enter—I went into No. 17, scaled the wall between the two yards, and saw the prisoner lying exhausted on a leaden balcony at the rear of No. 15—he was out of breath—when I arrested him he said, ""Don't hit me This is what I get for doing work for other people""—at the station he was charged by the prosecutor and made no reply.

Cross-examined. I did not see five other men go into the empty house; no other men were running—a thorough search was made in the empty house.

GUILTY of simple robbery. Six months' hard labour."
Theft,"HORATIO MILLER (282 s.) On July 14th I saw the prisoner about 3.50 p.m. in Page Street, Mill Hill, leading a pony with a hempen halter—he did not seem to know which way to go—I knew the pony; I had seen it in a cart—I stopped the prisoner and asked him where he was going with the pony—he said he had bought it—I said he would have to come back with me to Mr. Keen's—he said, ""I bought the f—-----pony""—I was taking him back when Keen met us, and said the pony belonged to him, and that it had been taken out of his field—he said he would charge the prisoner, and I took him to the station, where he was charged.

RICHARD JAMES KEEN . I reside at Good News Farm, Mill Hill—on Friday, July 14th, I missed my pony from my field about 3.30 p.m.—I had seen the prisoner leaning on the gate, and looking into the field where

the pony was—I next saw it opposite my farm with the policeman and the prisoner—the policeman asked if it was my pony—I said, ""Yes ""—he said he met the prisoner up the road with it.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. I saw a man's face who was looking over the gate—there is no footpath near there.

GEORGE FULLER (2 s.) On July 14th the prisoner was brought to the station—he said, ""I gave £4 10s. for the b—pony off a gipsy down the lane this afternoon""—I asked him what gipsy—he said he did not know, he could not say.

The prisoner, in his defence, said that he bought the pony half a mile away, and paid four sovereigns and four half-crowns for it.

GUILTY . He then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction of felony at Clerkenwell Green on June 24th, 1902, in the name of John Smith. Four other convictions were proved, including two terms of ten and twelve years, and commencing in 1861, for housebreaking, the others being for horse stealing. Twelve months' hard labour."
Royal Offences,"VICTORIA ALICE GARNE . I am the wife of Thomas Garner, the landlord of the John Bull, Bruce Road, Bromley—at 12.5 p.m. on June 16th the prisoner came in with a man for two half pints of beer, price 2d., tendering this counterfeit shilling in payment (Produced)—I at once detected it to be bad and sent for an officer—I told the prisoner it was bad and she said that she did not know it was—on the officer's arrival he asked her to turn her purse out—I gave the coin to him.

WILLIAM ELLIOT (806 K.) On June 16th I was called to the John Bull, where I saw Mrs. Garner and the prisoner—Mrs. Garner gave me a counterfeit shilling—the prisoner said she had tendered the coin, but did not know where she had got it from; she had either got it in change for a half-sovereign, or she had got it from a man; she did not know which—two half-crowns, a sixpence and 6d. in bronze, good money, were found upon her—when taken to the station and charged, she said she was a prostitute and had got it from a man—the inspector at the station refused the charge.

JOHN KNEWSTUBB . I am a potman at the Lion beerhouse, Girand Street, Poplar—at 11.30 p.m. on August 25th the prisoner and a man came in and had two or three glasses of refreshment, for which the prisoner paid—I cannot say whether she paid for each lot—before they had a pony of bitter the man paid—he went out and called the prisoner out—after two or three minutes she came out and said, ""Have you drawn that pony of bitter?""—she had ordered it as the man was calling her out—the price of a pony of bitter is 1d.—I said, ""No,"" and drew the pony and she put down this counterfeit shilling (Produced)—I said, ""This is bad,"" and she said, ""Oh, yes,"" and gave me a good shilling, for which I gave her 11d. change—I put the bad shilling on the counter with the change—my eldest brother went to the till and said in her presence. ""Here is another bad shilling""—I compared the two bad shillings and found they were both the same—referring to the one lying on the counter the prisoner said, ""I got it off a man I went round the corner with.""

ARTHUR LAYTON (867 K.) At 12.25 p.m. on August 25th I was called to the Lion beer-house, where I saw the prisoner and Knewstubb, who showed me a bad shilling—I asked the prisoner what she was doing with

such money as that and she said, ""I have been round the corner with a man. You know b—well who I am. I am a prostitute, and the man gave me two shillings, and now he has gone and left me. How did I know it was bad?""—I asked if she had any more like it and she said, ""No""—I saw she had a purse in her hand, and I took it—in it I found two six-pences and 7 3/4 d. in bronze, good money—I had never seen her before—the was taken to the station and charged with uttering one bad shilling, when she replied, ""Very well.""

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER . I am Inspector of Coin at His Majesty's Mint—I have three counterfeit shillings before me, of which these two shillings tendered at the Lion beer-house are from the same mould, which means that they, must come from the same source—I have seen as many as forty or fifty made from the same mould, but fifteen or twenty would be nearer the average; it depends on the skill of the maker and the strength of the mould.

The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate: ""Last Friday night, about 9, I was at the Green Gate public-house, Plaistow, and I met a gentleman who gave me a drink, a shilling, a sixpence, and 6d. in bronze. I felt tired and went towards Brick Lane for a lodging. I had some beer and was getting into a 'bus when a man took me into the Liverpool Arms, and we then went to Poplar. We called in and had a drink at another house. By the time we got to Knewstubb's it was 10 o'clock and I had 1s. 8 3/4 d. in my possession. The man paid for the drinks there. I never tendered any money nor paid for a drink there. At 12.20 the man took me outside, gave me a shilling and told me to get one and a half pints of ale in a can and get a drop for myself. He said he would be back, but never returned. When I called for the pennyworth of bitter I tendered the shilling the man gave me. My purse was in my pocket. John Knewstubb said it was bad and I said I did not know it, nor anything of the other bad shilling found in the till.""

The prisoner. ""I have nothing more to add.""

NOT GUILTY ."
Breaking Peace,"LEONARD BATCHELOUR (107 E.) I have been a constable ten months and a fortnight—in the early morning of August 7th I was on duty in Emerald Street, Theobald's Road, when I saw the prisoners and another man standing in the street using obscene language and fighting—I told them to go home and not make a row—they went a few yards and Alfred Sills turned round and came back to me and said, ""You are only half a f—man. I will f—well kill you""—the other man with him had gone away—Susan Sills came to the back of me and caught hold of me by the neck while Alfred held on to my feet and pulled me to the ground—he then jumped on my stomach with his feet twice while Susan punched my head, holding my arm—Alfred snatched my whistle and threw it away—he then ran down Emerald Street some fifty yards—Susan was still behind me and I shook her off—I picked up my whistle and ran after Alfred—I blew it as I ran along—I overtook him and caught hold of his.

neck—he wrestled with me and we both fell to the ground—he got on to the top of me and held my throat with his fingers—he knelt on my stomach, thumping me with his knees, while Susan punched my head—Speed then came to my assistance—I went to the station—the Divisional Surgeon saw me and attended to my injuries—I was on the sick list for about eleven days—my wrist and ankle were sprained—I have pains in my stomach still, and I still have marks on my shin—there were bruises on my ribs—neither prisoner was under the influence of drink at the time.

Cross-examined by Alfred Sills. It took me forty-five minutes to get from Bow Street to the police station where you were being tried—I had a stick to help me—I did not tell the Magistrate that I had no marks or bruises—I went to the Divisional Surgeon's house—there were mud marks from the heel and toe of a boot on my tunic—it was true when I said that I could not remember anything more after Speed arrived; I was knocked about so much—I was assisted to the station.

Cross-examined by Susan Sills. I have still got the mark on my head where you hit me; it has turned to an abscess now.

MARK SPEED (461 E.) About 12.20 a.m. on August 7th I was in Brownlow Street, which is about 200 yards from Emerald Street, when I heard a police whistle blown—I went to Theobald's Road, where I saw a large crowd running in the direction of Emerald Street—on arriving there I saw Batchelour struggling with the prisoners with a large crowd standing round—the prisoners had Batchelour between them, standing up—before I could get through the crowd they all fell to the ground, Batchelour at the bottom—Alfred bumped him with his knees and kicked him with his feet while Susan struck his head—I pulled her off and caught hold of Alfred, who had one hand over Batchelour's throat—I pulled him off—we struggled a bit and he said, ""I will do the same to you, as I did to your f—pal""—he threw me to the ground and got on top of me, but I overpowered him and got on top of him—Crabtree arrived and I directed his attention to Batchelour, who was standing up, but in a very exhausted and rocky condition—I took Alfred to the station—I brought back the ambulance, and met Susan being taken to the station—she was very violent and refused to walk, so we put her on the ambulance.

Cross-examined by Alfred Sills. You might have fallen into the position I saw you, but you had no cause to bump your knees; you were free to get on to your feet—Batchelour could not use his legs—I suppose I was ten to fifteen yards away when I first saw you—Batchelour would have been choked if you had not released your hold of his throat—you did not get the chance to bump me with your knees—Constable 463 E assisted to take you to the station—he was not called at the Police Court, because he did not see the assault—I had nothing to do with your wife except to help put her in the ambulance.

JOHN CRABTREE (91.E.) At 12.20 a.m. on August 7th I was near Emerald Street when I heard a police whistle go—I went to Emerald

Street when I saw a crowd—Speed was holding Alfred on the ground and Batchelour had hold of Susan—I went to Speed's assistance, who directed me to go to Batchelour's assistance—she was hitting him in the face and I took her away from him—he was very exhausted—I took her into custody—half-way to the station I had to send a private individual for an ambulance, as she became so violent—Speed fetched the ambulance back—Batchelour assisted to take her for about 100 yards, but he became very exhausted and could not go on.

WILLIAM WELCH (Inspector E.) I was in charge of the Gray's Inn Road police station on August 7th when the prisoners were brought in, Susan in an ambulance—Batchelour came to the station just before by himself in an exhausted condition—I sent him to the Divisional Surgeon, after he had given an account of the assault in the prisoners' hearing—the prisoners were then charged with assaulting him and they made no reply; they were shouting and bawling.

Cross-examined by Alfred Sills. You were brought in before your wife—the police had some difficulty in bringing you to the station—after Batchelour had had a rest he was in a fit state to go to the doctor.

CHARLES HAYMORE HILL , M.D. I am a registered medical practitioner, of 45, Mecklenburgh Square—I was acting for the Divisional Surgeon on August 7th when in the early morning Batchelour came in—he was looking very pale and suffering from shock, and could hardly hold himself upright—he complained of pain about the pit of his stomach, round the right side of his ribs and in various parts of his body where he had been injured—he had much difficulty in drawing his breath—his right wrist and right ankle were sprained, there were two abrasions on his right shin, and his right knee was swollen and bruised—there was a tenderness along the margin of his ribs on the right side and there were marks of mud on the front of his uniform covering the injury to his ribs, unmistakably caused by kicks from a boot, and there was a quantity of mud all down the right side of his trousers—I could distinguish the whole footmark on the front of his tunic, which was consistent with the prisoner jumping on him with both his feet—he was perfectly sober—I advised that he should be put on the sick list and I attended him for eleven days afterwards.

Cross-examined by Alfred Sills. I said at the Police Court that Batchelour came between 12.30 and 1 a.m.; I do not swear to any particular time—I only attended at the second hearing at the Police Court—I do not think the bruises on the constable's shin could have been caused by his leg hitting the kerb; I would undertake to tell the difference between those and kick marks—I swear they were kick marks—I believe he walked back to the station—the sprain to his ankle would cause him much pain, especially when walking—it is not half a mile from my house to the station—I did not consider it my duty to put him in a cab—I glanced professionally at his neck—I did not notice any marks there—I saw there were none—I have no note of his having complained of your having seized him by the throat.

Alfred Sills, in his defence on oath, said that his home having been burnt down the night before, he was taking his wife to her mother's to stop the night; that having had a little to drink they were singing when Batchelour pushed his wife; that he resented it and a struggle ensued; that his wife left him and went into her mother's, returning in time to see him arrested, when she was arrested also; that he did not kick or jump on Batchelour, but may have hit him accidentally; that he did not get up and run away; that neither Speed nor Crabtree came up, but two other constables whom he could identify; that he had forgotten to cross-examine Speed and Crabtree as to that, but he had it on his notes to do so.

Evidence for the Defence.

SUSAN WRIGHT (By the COURT). I am the mother of Susan Sills, and live at 16, Emerald Street—my daughter was married to Alfred Sills last October.

By Alfred Sills. My daughter has suffered from hysteria for years, especially if she gets a glass of beer; when she has a fit it takes four or, at times, five to hold her—she does not seem to know what she is doing, and she has done injury to herself.

Cross-examined. I expected my daughter to come in that night—I went out on the Sunday to my son's to dinner and did not come home that night—I do not think I have known her to assault a policeman.

Susan Sills, in her defence on oath, said that she and her husband were going to her mother's; that they were singing from having had a little to drink when Batchelour came up and pushed her; that a struggle ensued between him and her husband; that she went to her mother's and on her return found her husband bad been taken into custody; that she did not assault Batchelour in any way, but she was taken into custody, and that on the way to the station she had a hysterical fit, when she did not know what she did.

GUILTY .

ALFRED SILLS then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction of felony at the Mansion House on January 8th, 1902. Three previous convictions were proved against him— Fifteen months' hard labour. SUSAN SILLS— Six months' hard labour."
Killing,"ADOLFO ANTONELLI (23) , Contriving and intending to justify the crimes of assassination and murder, and encouraging and inciting other persons to commit those crimes, and unlawfully printing and publishing and procuring to be printed and published in a pamphlet called ""L'lnsurrezione"" a scandalous and malicious libel in the Italian language. Other counts. Encouraging persons unknown to murder the Sovereigns and Rulers of Europe and endeavouring to persuade persons, whose names are unknown, to murder the Sovereigns and Rulers of Europe and particularly His Majesty King Emanuel III., King of Italy. And FRANCESCO BARBERI (33) , For aiding and abetting Antonelli in the commission of the said misdemeanour.

MR. MUIR and MR. BODKIN Prosecuted; MR. THOMPSON and MR. THORNE Defended Antonelli; MR. HUTTON and MR. MARTIN O'CONNOR Defended Barberi.

ISRAEL NARODICZKY . I am a printer at 48, Mile End Road—I know Antonelli and a man named Baron, who is a Russian tailor—in the week beginning July 9th I saw Baron at my premises—after his first visit he came with Antonelli, whom he introduced as an editor who wanted to print an Italian paper—Baron spoke to me in Yiddish—I had made arrangements with him about doing some printing and when he came with Antonelli he said, ""This is the man who wants to print the paper""—I told Antonelli that I did not understand the language, and as this was an anarchist paper I did not want to print it, but if I was told there was nothing in the paper I would take it—he told me the paper was all right—I spoke to him in English—I did not understand the language the paper was in, but I gathered that it was an anarchist paper—he said, ""It is all legal and you can print it""—I told him the manuscript must be very plain writing, because I did not understand the language, and if it was not plain I could not set it up—he said, ""The writing will be very plain""—I had told Baron before the price, and that day I received £1 deposit from Antonelli—a few days later I got some manuscript by post and proceeded to set up the type—Antonelli called on me a few times and corrected the proofs—he said a thousand copies were to be printed—I printed a thousand and Antonelli called and took away the parcel which contained them—there was another man with him—that was on a Friday—I do not remember the date; it was in July—it was about two weeks after his first visit—in the middle of the time I received some money and at the last I received the rest—altogether I bad from Antonelli £4 7s. which included the £1 I received the first day—when Antonelli took the papers away he told me to keep the type, because he wanted another 1,000 printed—he asked me about the price for the second 1,000 and the arrangement was £1 2s.—I agreed to keep the type set up, and I afterwards handed it over to the police—this paper (Produced) is one of the copies I printed—I have since been to Scotland yard and seen some further copies printed from my type—at the end

of each week I burn the manuscript because the dustmen will not take the waste paper away—I remember the handwriting of the manuscript; this paper (Ex. 1) is in the same writing; it is a list of subscriptions and appears in the last column of the paper.

Cross-examined by MR. THOMPSON. I do not remember Antonelli bringing me some manuscripts when he came to see me about the printing—he did not tell me, when I asked him that the writing should be plain, that he would copy it, but he told me it would be very plain—I remember the handwriting, although I do not know Italian, because I am a printer and see several handwritings, and that makes an impression on me.

By the COURT. I am quite sure that this list is in the same writing as the manuscript.

GEORGE RILEY (Sergeant, Criminal Investigation Department). On Saturday, July 29th, about 2.15 p.m, I went to 41, Dean Street, Soho, which is a newspaper shop occupied by Barberi—I saw him in the back room of the shop from which he came—on the counter I saw this copy of ""L'lnsurrezione"" (Produced)—I bought it—Barberi charged 6d. for it—I asked him if he had any more and he said, ""That is the last for the present""—I was in plain clothes—the same day with Constable Kirchner I went to the shop about 2.45 and on the counter I saw thirteen copies of ""L'lnsurrezione""—Barberi was behind the counter—I seized the copies and said to him, ""Have you any more?""—he said, ""No""—I said, ""If you sell any more of these you will be prosecuted""—next day I went to 20, Manor Street, Chelsea, about 12.5—it is a barber's shop—I do not remember if there was any name over the door—I spoke to a woman in the passage—shortly afterwards Antonelli came to the door of his room at the back—in the room was a woman whom I now know as Delfina Rutizo—I made as if to go into the room and Antonelli put his arm across the doorway and prevented me, and Delfina stayed close to him—Detective Fitch was with me—I said, ""We are police officers and we are making inquiries respecting this paper,"" showing him the copy which I had purchased the day before; ""Are you the editor and the publisher of it?""—he replied, ""Yes, I am""—I asked him where he had it printed and he replied, ""In Switzerland and Geneva""—I asked him how many copies he had had printed and he said, ""Two thousand""—I asked him to show me those still in his possession—he replied, ""I distributed them all among my friends yesterday,"" and added that he had one copy left—I asked him to show it to me, which he did—I took it from him and, saying that I should keep it, I handed it to Fitch—Antonelli said, ""You must not take it; that is the last copy I have left for myself""—I said, ""Now you say you are the editor of this paper; where is your name on it?""—he said, ""There,"" and pointed to the last column at the top of page 8—these other copies (Produced) are what I have seized—I said to him, ""Then you are Adolfo Antonelli?""—I was reading from the paper and he said, ""Yes, I am""—I said, ""Where are the manuscripts relating to the articles in this journal?""—he said, ""The printer has them. I have sent them all to him""—I said, ""Which articles did you write in this paper?""—he replied, ""I did not

write any; I only corrected the grammatical mistakes and the printer's errors; the articles were all written by persons in Italy""—I asked him how much the paper had cost him, and he said he had not paid anything yet and that he did not know how much it would cost him for printing—I said, ""How many copies did you leave with Barberi?""—he replied, ""I do not know; I gave some to him and some to my friends who were in the shop yesterday""—I asked him for their names and he would not give them to me, but subsequently he said, ""I gave some to Ranieri""—I again asked him to show me the copies which were in his possession and he said, ""I distributed them yesterday in the anarchist centres""—I did not go into his room—he said he knew something about the law and that I could not enter the room without his permission—on August 7th, about 11 p.m., I went to 41, Dean Street, with other officers and saw Barberi behind the counter—we said to him, ""We have got a warrant for your arrest""—he requested it to be read, which was done by Sergeant Macbride—I spoke in English to him—he speaks English well—he said, ""I am innocent. I have done no wrong""—we took him to Bow Street and he was detained until the following day—on August 8th I went to 20, Manor Street, and searched the premises—I did not find anybody there—the whole of the people with whom Antonelli lived had left, and the premises were entirely empty.

Cross-examined by MR. THOMPSON. I got my instructions to make enquiries from Scotland Yard—I have not yet visited the Italian Embassy or the Consul-General—when I had this conversation with Antonelli at his house I had no intention of arresting him—most of the conversation was in English, but I spoke a few words to him in French respecting his birthplace—I never warn persons when making enquiries—I had seized a great number of these papers on the previous day and had seen his name as a person to whom communications could be sent, but I knew it long before then.

Cross-examined by MR. HUTTON. Barberi's shop in Dean Street is an ordinary newspaper shop; I suppose about 16 ft. by 12 ft in size—it was filled with all kinds of papers; there might have been ten or fifteen kinds of Italian papers there and about the same number of French, ""Le Petit Journal,"" ""Le Matin"" and other harmless papers—some English papers were there also—Barberi has been there since the end of January—to all appearances his shop was a genuine one—I spoke English to him, which he speaks very well—the paper which I took first was being sold on the counter—when I told him that if he sold any more I should prosecute him, he knew that I was a police officer, but I told him that I was a police officer to make certain—I told him I should prosecute him if he sold the papers because I was carrying out my instructions—I did not tell him what I should prosecute him for, but he understood that distinctly—I did not hear him say that, as far as he knew, there was nothing wrong in selling the papers—I did not point out to him any objectionable or offensive parts—I did not tell him why he should not sell the papers.

Re-examined. The main conversation with Antonelli was carried on

in English—there were several other anarchist papers among those sold by Barberi, both in Italian and French—I have got here one or two which I bought in his shop.

HERBERT FITCH (Detective). On July 29th I was near Barberi's shop when I saw Antonelli take a parcel in and another man took a second parcel in—they were together—the parcels were placed on the counter and opened by Antonelli, and a certain number of copies were taken from them by him, handed to Barberi and then placed under the counter—I saw that it was a journal of some description in the parcels, but I could not identify them; I was looking through the window—it was about 1.50.

Cross-examined by MR. HUTTON. A small quantity of papers were left on the counter—I cannot say what other papers were on the counter; there were some there evidently for sale.

LIONEL KIRCHNER (Detective). On July 29th I was at Dean Street and went to Barberi's shop about 2.5 p.m.—I saw there Antonelli, Barberi and his brother—I saw a bundle of ""L'Insurrezione"" lying on the counter being folded up by Barberi, junior—Antonelli was leaning on the counter doing up a parcel which looked like papers—I bought ten copies at 6d. each, which the prisoner, Barberi, sold me—I went into the shop again that afternoon about 2.40 with Riley and saw him seize thirteen copies on the counter—Riley held up the copies and said, ""If you sell any more of these you will be prosecuted.""

Cross-examined by MR. HUTTON. I spoke English to Barberi—he had no hesitation in selling me the copies.

FRANCIS POWELL (Sergeant). On Saturday, July 29th, between 11 and 13 a.m., I commenced keeping observation on Barberi's shop up to about 5.40 p.m.—I passed the shop several times—I did not see Riley go in—after about 2.45 I saw about twenty persons leave the shop with copies of ""L'lnsurrezione""—about 6.30 I went to the shop with Riley and others and saw Barberi—I said to him, ""Can I speak with you privately, Mr. Barberi?""—he said, ""This is private enough for me. I know who you are""—I said, ""I must speak with you""—he came to the back of the shop—I said to him interrogatively, ""You have been selling a paper called 'L Insurrezione'""—he said, ""Yes, but I have no more of it""—I said, ""Who is the editor or printer of this paper?""—he said, ""I do not know his name; you will find it in the paper, and your colleague, indicating Sergeant Riley, ""has got one, I think""—I said, ""But I want to know from you""—he replied, ""I will tell you nothing""—I also said, ""I want to know who brought the papers for sale""—he walked behind the counter—I said, ""Since you will tell me nothing, I will find out for myself,"" and seeing that he appeared to be trying to hide something with his back, I looked in that direction and saw a number of the papers on a shelf behind the counter as if for sale, with several other lots of different papers—I took them—Barberi tried to prevent me reaching them, but as he saw I was determined to have them, he did not offer any strong resistance—I found that there were forty copies of the paper—I searched the shop and afterwards the rooms—on searching the shop Barberi did not appear to like the trouble the search would cause and said, ""Now

I will tell you. Antonelli brought the papers here, and about an hour ago he took them away""—it was then 7.15—he said that Antonelli had brought them at 2 o'clock—I said, ""How do you account for the possession of those I have just seized?""—he hesitated an instant and said, ""Antonelli brought them all here""—I asked him the price and he said, ""Some pay a penny, others twopence, others sixpence and some a shilling. There is no price. Since I was cautioned to-day I have sold very few, perhaps five or six""—I said I had seen several leave the shop—he said, ""They were distributed by Antonelli""—there was a man named Ranieri in the shop—he had some papers in his hand—I said, ""What have you got there?""—he did not wish me to see them—I said, ""I will see,"" and he let me see them—they were five copies of ""L'Insurrezione""—he said he got them from Antonelli—on August 7th a warrant was granted and a communication made to the Southampton police—on August 8th I went to Southampton with Sergeant Macnamara and there found Antonelli detained—I said, ""I have a warrant for your arrest""—he smiled and seemed rather pleased to see me, and asked if I was about to take him to London—I said ""By and bye""—before I did so I saw Emilie Sala at 17, Council Buildings, Southampton—on her table there I saw a letter, the envelope being addressed to Madam Sala—it was partly opened and ""Caro Antonelli"" was showing—the letter had an address on it which I took a note of, 87, Patshull Road, Kentish Town—after I saw the letter at Sala's I went back to Antonelli and took him up to London—in the train I said, ""Do not you wish to have the warrant read?""—he shrugged his shoulders as if with an air of indifference and said, ""Yes, read it""—I did so and he said, ""All right, I understand what you have read"" or ""what you are reading. I do not know whether the immorality or incitation comes to assassination in my paper""—he said that in English—he afterwards said that the paper was printed in Switzerland; the proofs were sent to him by post, he corrected them and returned them by the same means—he did not say how he came to be in Southampton—he said that two comrades came to London on Sunday and he passed the day with them, but he would not say their names—the Southampton police handed me some property—Antonelli was taken to Bow Street police station—on the 9th I went to 87, Patshull Road, and found this trunk (Produced) and took possession of it—I was present when the two prisoners were charged at Bow Street—Antonelli made no reply and Barberi said, ""I do not know anything about it. I only put the papers in my shop. Antonelli brought them""—I searched the trunk and found in it a number of documents and papers, including Exhibit No. 1 and a passport in the name of Adolfo Antonelli, which purports to be signed by him—also a number of photographic negatives from which Exhibit a was printed—I was not there when it was done, but I have the negative—it shows the two prisoners—I also found this portrait, which purports to be of Gaetano Bresci, headed July 29th, 1900: ""Who, comprehending in his heart all the tears and the hatred of the mothers, wives and children of the massacred by the royal lead in the butchery of Sicily and Milan, taught the cowards how the murderers of the people ought to be punished""—that is in English

—I also found a letter signed Adolfo and addressed to Delfina in the box, and a photograph of Antonelli with the writing on top of it, ""To my Delfina, 20th April, 1904""—I found two slips with writing on relating to the circulation of ""L'lnsurrezione"" in two towns, also a registration of the French domicile of Antonelli, dated July, 1902, and a newspaper called ""II Grido della Folla,"" dated March 18th, 1905, and another copy of the same paper of June 3rd, also a copy of ""L'Aurora,"" dated March 3rd, 1905; also this little red book, with a number of entries relating to money matters.

Cross-examined by MR. THOMPSON. These papers describe themselves as being weekly.

Cross-examined by MR. HUTTON. When you are standing on the public side of the counter you might be able to reach across to where the papers were, but it would be inconvenient—it is an ordinary counter—Barberi did not offer me any violent resistance, but pushed against me to prevent me going behind the counter—I did not see the paper when I went in until he attracted my attention by standing in front of them—I could have seen them, but I did not.

FLORENCE CONSIGLIO . I am English and married to Veto Consiglio, who is an Italian—I am now living at 22, Manor Street, Chelsea—last Christmas I was living at 20, Manor Street, Chelsea—my husband was a hairdresser there—we had a vacant room at the back of the shop which my husband permitted Antonelli to live in—he paid rent when he had it and was able to work—he is a stonemason—a woman whom I believed was his wife lived there with him, named Delfina—we left those premises on Saturday, August 5th—on July 30th Antonelli occupied the room until the evening—he was not there at night and never came again—I recognise this trunk as being in his room; it was taken away on the Saturday that I left by Carter, Paterson's man.

EDWIN WILMSHURST . I am a carman employed by Carter, Paterson & Co.—on Friday, August 4th, I collected a box from 20, Manor Street, Chelsea—I was asked to do so by Antonelli on that day and he then asked me to call for two boxes on Saturday, the 5th, and asked me what time I would be round—I said about the same time—he was then standing in the doorway of No. 22—I said, ""Shall I come here?""—he said, ""No, call at 20""—I called the next day and collected this box—it was addressed—a female put a label on addressed to Kentish Town—I took it to the depot to be forwarded in the ordinary way.

ARTHUR GEORGE GREGORY . I am employed by Carter, Paterson & Co., at their depot at Chalk Farm—I delivered this box on Saturday night, August 5th, to a foreigner, I do not know who, at 29, Patshull Road, Kentish Town—the gentleman signed for it—the name is Corieo.

JOHN CARTER (Detective Sergeant, Southampton Police). On Monday, August 7th, I read a telegram from Scotland Yard containing a description of a person who was wanted—the same day I was in St. Michael's Square, Southampton, and saw Antonelli—I stopped him, told him I was a police officer, and said, ""You answer the description of a man wanted in

London for inciting to murder. How long have you been in Southampton?""—he said, ""A fortnight""—subsequently he said two days—I took him to the police station and asked him to write his name—he wrote on this piece of paper (Produced), ""Alfredo Politi""—I asked him if his name was Antonelli and he stoutly denied it—I said, ""You are the man I am looking for,"" and he afterwards wrote his proper name, ""Antonelli Adolfo""—I detained him until the London police came—I saw him write both these pieces of paper.

Cross-examined by MR. THOMPSON. I asked him to write his name down when I took him to the station—I had no warrant, but I arrested him then and there.

Re-examined, I asked him to write his name because I had an idea he was telling me lies.

THOMAS HENRY GURRIN . For over twenty years I have devoted myself to the study of handwriting, and on many occasions I have given evidence upon the subject in Courts of Justice—I have had submitted to me for comparison these two pieces of writing produced by Carter—I have compared them with the writing upon a number of other documents which were seized by the police—this Exhibit No. 1, I think, is in the same writing as the other documents [MR. THOMPSON admitted that Exhibit No. 1 was in Antonelli's writing]—the letter beginning, ""Delfina mia"" is in the same writing—the writing on Exhibit 3, which is part of an identification certificate, resembles that of Antonelli, but I will not speak to it with, certainty; the signature on the other side is undoubtedly his—the photograph to Delfina also bears Antonelli's writing.

FRANCIS CARR . I live at 13, Walcot Gardens, Kensington, and am well acquainted with Italian—I have before me prints of ""L'Insurrezione"" which I have made a translation of—on page 20 of the translation there is a passage, ""July 29th, 1900-1905. To Gaetano Bresci, who by the spontaneous sacrifice of his own liberty, freed Italy from that crowned monster Humbert I. To Gaetano Bresci, who alone amongst the general cowardliness knew how to rise and strike the murderer of the starved ones of Italy. To our heroic companion, barbarously murdered in the prison of St. Stephen by the order of the deformed Emanuel III., we send to day—the fifth anniversary of the event—our sincere salutations as fighters with the ardent desire, the firm determination to follow him, as quickly as possible, on the way, by him so brightly marked out—to rebellion. Hail!! The anarchists of the Insurrection""—to the best of my knowledge that is perfectly correct—on page 1 I find the English heading of the paper, ""London, July 29th, 1905,"" and the motto, ""The future we are Thought and Dynamite,"" then ""The Insurrection."" ""A single number issued by a group of anarchists. Price 10 centmi, to go to funds of revolutionary propaganda""—then follows the translation of an article called Insurrection, and on page 4 I find, ""It is necessary that, taught by experience of past abortive movements, by all those sad episodes in which the flesh of the children of the people was torn to strips by the bullets in the service of tyranny, the people should be taught that to the arms of the soldier a more intelligent answer should be given than cobblestones""—a little lower down, ""To

reach all this we have need of efficacious means and of firm and daring deeds. Those who are willing must arm themselves and be of one accord as to the work to be undertaken, so that when the people, pushed by hunger or by any other reason to enter the public squares to make their usual protests, may be found ready to face the situation and to initiate with decision the action against the class which detains the social riches. Arms and every explosive material must, under these circumstances, be furnished to the people, teaching them by word and example, where and how the employ of such means may have useful results for the revolutionary cause""—on page 5, ""Let the monarchy of the thieves of Savoy be removed from the bloody throne of Italy, and with her also fall the monarchies of other States, by the violent action of the people made to rise by the spur of the anarchists. Let us begin by throwing down the first obstacle when we have overthrown the thrones and trodden under foot the altars, then we shall think of the rest""—on page 6 there is, ""Procure arms, have at your disposal all the most modern discoveries of science which may secure you the victory in the struggle against the bulwarks of the bourgeoisie tyrants. And when the hour of the final rising will strike, when we shall feel strong and decided, let us descend on the squares, arms in hand. Let the streets be again barricaded. Let dynamite help in the work of destruction and annihilation by being employed in blowing up every edifice which would afford a shelter to any man belonging to the class that reigns and despoils us; and also every man who forsakes our class to become a puppet of the other party. You who are willing to work, wherever the spark may come from, be it from frozen Russia of the gallows and of the knout, from Spain of the modern inquisitor, from the hypocritical Republic France, or from Italy, made miserable and sad by the tyranny of the brigands of Savoy, wherever the mass of workers which rebels against the yoke which oppresses it, wherever begins the resurrection of the people, wherever the insurrection may break out, there with arms in hand we shall be found. (Sd.) Those of the Insurrection""—then follows an article called, ""An Open Letter,"" and on page 9, ""If under the leaden yoke of servility, which weighs on all and everything, if in this great and servile tragedy, within which generous hearts are suffering in vain oppressed by the cowardice of the many, if from time to time did not shine the flash of the dagger, or if the sound of the menacing bomb was not heard, or if a handful of men did not hoist the red flag where, being stronger than opposition, they could use the rifle, then indeed would our souls be desperately deprived of every thread of hope""—I have missed out in the translation some words; it should read, ""Or if a handful of men did not hoist the red flag where oppression is most atrocious and rather than to delay the use of the rifle, then indeed would our souls be desperately deprived of every thread of hope""—later on I find an article headed, ""To thee, O Soldier! ""and on page 25 I find, ""The army serves to defend the masters, the capitalists, and the idle from the recognised representations of the workmen who have been despoiled, and from the wretched starving people""—on page 26

I find, ""On that day, the day of the Insurrection of the people against their tyrants, you know what you must do if you wish us to again consider you as a brother: Desert the ranks—unite yourself to those whom with you have a life of common miseries, and fire—yes, fire—but remember that those on whom you must fire are not those insufficiently covered by rags, but those wearing gold lace and decorations; they are not your brothers, but your tyrants. Soldier, in front of the rising people, before the advancing future, to-day, to-morrow, for ever, on every occasion your sole duty is to desert the ranks and fire on your officers, and on the enemies of the people. Soldier, up with your rifle—grasp the hand which your fellow worker extends to you and shout with us 'Hurrah for the Social Revolution'""—I think ""Up with your rifle"" means ""Pointed in the air""—the next article is headed ""War—Country and Social Democracy,"" and on page 29 I find a paragraph, ""And the country? Who knows it? Ask all those dead from hunger and bullets, the homeless, and the wanderers in all lands in search of that bread which their country denied them. They alone can tell you. We pride our selves on being those who have given up all; we know no country we consider as much as a brother a man born in Italy as one born in Russia or Patagonia""—on page 35 I find, ""To those comrades who receive this sole number we warmly recommend—to circulate it especially in Italy—to let us know at least with a post-card that they have received it, so that we may know that their address is of service, and to send us at once the amount realised, if the propaganda initiated by us can be useful, and if they wish that we should continue it with other numbers, by pamphlets, open and otherwise, of frankly revolutionary propaganda. For all matters concerning the editing and administration of this number, the address is Adolfo Antonelli, 20, Manor Street, Chelsea, London""—amongst the list of subscribers I find ""Southampton, E. Sala, 3, 6""—at the very end of the paper there is a kind of general invitation by the companions, interested in the anarchist propaganda to attend a private meeting on Thursday, August 3rd, in the meeting place of the P.S.I. in Charlotte Street, ""The editor of 'L'Insurrezione' will be present from 8.30 to 12.30 of the same evening""—there are two slips relating to the circulation of ""L'Insurrezione"" through Italy—this (Produced) is a letter to ""My Delfina"" from Southampton, dated August 6th: ""I left this morning at 8 and arrived here at 10.30 and was pleasantly received by these comrades. They tell me that I can easily and quickly embark. Have courage, then, and hope that your Adolfo will be able to get a situation and have you again by his side. For my part I earnestly desire it and anxiously await the moment when I shall be able to embrace you tightly. As these comrades had not sleeping room for me in their house I hired a room at four shillings and although they wished to pay for it I paid myself. I have my meals, and good ones, with them, but I wish, if possible, to pay my own lodging. Perhaps to-morrow I shall go to work as extra hand in a kitchen for a week, and thus be able to earn at least a sovereign. Send me as soon as possible clean handkerchiefs, socks and my shirt; if I can I will buy some things here. I hope that by now

you are perfectly at ease as regards myself, and that you will now eat and be prudent. Write me quickly, reassuring me on this matter, as it strikes me you must suffer. The journey cost me four shillings only, so that I am still rich. The address is Emilie Sala, 17, Council Buildings, Southampton. Wish me well as I wish you well, be calm and accept a good kiss from yours always, Adolfo""—this (Produced) is a portion of a newspaper ""II Grido della Folia"" dated March 18th, 1905, which reads:"". After the tragedy of Monza. bourgeosie—reactionaries and social reformers—sang the praises of the deceased and railed against Bresci. The newspaper 'I'Avanti' said, 'As individualist anarchists are wild beasts they must be treated as wild beasts'. But if Bresci was a wild beast for having killed a man, we do not know what epithet to apply to the Czar.""—those are extracts and not in sequence—there is another extract from the same paper, ""Under the auspices of a few anarchists in London, will shortly be published the sole number of 'L' Insurrezione' which, putting aside every question of theory and tendency, will wage a vigorous war in favour of revolutionary tactics, preaching the necessity for action and the conceptions which will inform it. Hurry up the orders, accompanied by the relative value, to Companion Adolfo Antonelli, 20, Manor Street, King's Road, Chelsea, London. Ten centesime per copy.""

Cross-examined by MR. THORNE. I am not an Italian—I have had some knowledge of Italian literature—I may have heard of an Italian poet named Rapisardi, but I do not remember it—I do not know that the motto of this paper comes from a collection of poems of his, called ""Guistizia""—this is not the first time I have done translations for Scotland Yard—I have not done translations for the Italian Embassy or the Italian Consul-General—I did not make the translation for the Information—I should say ""ratico"" means ""rickety""—I put deformed in the translation, but rickety is deformed—I had no object in making it worse than it is; I simply translated—I do not know how I came to leave out on page 9 of the translation, ""If at times the flash of the dagger did not show out, or the fierce menacing sound of the bomb did not sound, or the hand of the audacious man did not raise the red flag where the pressure is most atrocious, where also the mob""—but it is easily done when you have along thing to translate; I do not know the meaning of ""shala""—""then our souls would be desperately deprived of every thread of hope.""

Re-examined. My mother was an Italian, my father an Englishman—the police came to me as a person qualified to translate Italian. [The COURT said that Mr. Carr had apparently only made two slips, and that the other passages were not apparently questioned.]

COMMENDATORE BALDASSARE CEOLA . I am Inspector-General in the Public Security Department in Italy—on July 29th, 1900, I was Director of the Police of Milan—I received a telegram and a phonogramme and went to Monza at once by special train, where I found a man in custody for having killed the King, and he said his name was Gaetano Bresci—I was the first to speak to him—he told me he had killed the King with a revolver shot—this appears to be a portrait of Bresci—I was present

at his trial on August 29th, when he was convicted of the murder of the King and was sentenced to segregation for life—he was confined in the prison of St. Stephen; he committed suicide in prison.

Cross-examined by MR. THORNE. I was not in Milan in 1898; I was at Rome—I know that in 1898 there was a rising of the people in Milan—I do not know that the number of killed in that rising was more than 400—I heard that two members of the Italian Parliament, Turati and De Andreis, were tried by a military tribunal, and also a priest, Don Albertario, who was Director of the Osservatore Cattolico, for inciting the people to rise—Turati and De Andreis were sentenced to fifteen years' penal servitude and Don Albertario to ten years—in Italy newspapers in free, but the first copy or proof must be given to the Public Prosecutor—I cannot testify that the words in this paper (Produced) are what Bresci said at his trial—when I put the interrogation the first time to him, he said, ""I have not killed a man, I have killed a King""—(Paper read): ""I have attempted the life of the Chief of the State because, in my opinion, he is responsible for all the victims of the system that he represents to the defenders. As I have said several times, I conceived such a design after the bloody repression of Sicily seven or eight years ago""—there are ten or eleven anarchist papers published in Italy.

[MR. THORNE said that the suggestion was that this prosecution would be impossible in Italy, and that the Italian Government was using the English Courts to do what they could not do in the Italian Courts, MR. MUIR stated that the Italian Government knew nothing about the matter until the witness was communicated with about coming to this country. MR. MUIR desired that the witness should be thanked on behalf of the Government for attending]

[MR. THOMPSON objected to the indictment and contended that no specific person was mentioned in the counts for conspiracy, the term ""Sovereigns and rulers"" being vague, and submitted that there was no evidence of inciting to kill Victor Emanuel III. of Italy. MR. JUSTICE PHILLIMORE said that he considered the word ""Rulers"" vague, but ""Sovereigns of Europe"" was sufficiently definite; that ""Rulers"" was probably intended to embrace the President of a Republic. He upheld the indictment, but thought that the words ""Rulers of Europe"" should be left out.]

GUILTY . ANTONELLI— Ten months' hard labour. BARBERI— Nine months' hard labour."
Theft,"WILLIAM INGRAM (741 N.) About 7.15 p.m. on September 7th I saw the prisoner at a fixed point in Green Lanes—he came up to me and said, ""I wish to give myself up for sending threatening letters to Mrs. stokes and a man of my regiment""—I asked him if he meant the threats—he replied, ""Yes, I do""—I took him to 65, Riversdale Road, where the prosecutrix lived—before that he gave me this, little piece of paper wrote in pencil: ""I, George Simms, wish to give myself up for sending threatening letters to Mrs. Stokes, 65, Riversdale Road""—I did not see him write that—he said he had just wrote it, and that he meant to carry out what he said—he gave me the paper—at 65, Riversdale Road, I asked Mrs. Stokes if she had received any letters and she said, ""Yes""—she did not at once identify the prisoner as being a man she knew, but she did within a few minutes, and said he was a brother of the young lady that she had brought up from a baby—she did not give her name—I asked Mrs. Stokes would she prosecute and she said she would, and that she was in danger of her life—that was in the prisoner's presence—I took: him to the station, where he repeated in the presence of the inspector a

statement that he would kill Mrs. Stokes if he did not receive the money—he was then charged and said, ""Right.""

MARY ANN ELLIZA STOKES . I am the wife of George Stokes, a compositor, of 65, Riversdale Road, Highbury—I know the prisoner—he is the brother of the young woman who has been my help for over thirty years—her name was Amy Clifton, but she is now Mrs. Colling—on ""September 5th I received a letter, on September 6th a second, and on September 7th a third (Ex. B., dated September 5th): ""Mrs. Stokes, Don't forget the money to-night, because if you do you must put up with the punishment; I am starving; that is what makes me desperate, so don't forget. I was watching all your movements last night. I saw you go in the grocer's shop, then along of some man to post a letter in the pillar box. I walked the side of you last night down Riversdale Road, and you did not know me, so it will be easy for me to do what I want to do if you don't send me some money to-night. G. S. Bring some money outside Surrey Theatre, Blackfriars Road, to-night""—the envelope is addressed, ""Mrs. Stokes, 65, Riversdale Road, Highbury""—I also received this letter, dated September 6th: ""Mrs. Stokes, you have not sent me any money, so look out. Revenge is sweet, and my knife is sharp""—I think all the letters came by post, but the first one was not paid for, and we had to pay 2d.—we sent two letters to the police station, the third we had sent to the prisoner's sister at St. Albans—it was the one dated September 5th.

SAMUEL SCARFF (Inspector N.) I took the charge against the prisoner when he was brought to the station on September 7th—he said, ""I sent some threatening letters to Mrs. Stokes; if she don't send me some money I intend to kill her""—I gave him an envelope and asked him to address it to Mrs. Stokes—he did so in my presence—I compared it with the letters produced by Mrs. Stokes, and in my opinion the handwriting is the same—I was afterwards shown another letter by Mrs. Stokes, which appeared to the in the same writing—it was dated September 5th.

AMY COLLING . My name was once Amy Clifton—I have lived for over thirty years, before I was married, with Mrs. Stokes—the prisoner is my brother.

The prisoner's defence. ""I have suffered with my head a lot and I have ""been put away in an asylum once, and I have been under observation, I should like my stepmother to speak for me.""

Evidence for the Defence.

ANNIE CLIFTON (By the COURT). I am the prisoner's stepmother—I married his father in September, thirty years ago—I took the prisoner as a baby—he lived at home until he was thirteen, when he was sent to a school at Redhill—I used to visit him every six months—it was a philanthropic or truant school—he got on pretty well, but suffered cruelly from his head, and he always has done at times since he was a child—he stayed at the school for three years—when he came out he did a little work as a labourer and then went into the Army—at times he was sensible, but he had to lose many days on account of his head—he could not bear any noise; he used

to sit very quiet as though he did not want anyone to speak to him; at other times he was all right—he was like that nearly every month; sometimes it would last a couple of days, sometimes not more than a day—I do not know what regiment he went into—he was away from home for over twelve months, and I did not see him—he wrote to me now and then, but not very sensibly at times—at other times he would write sensibly—he was discharged from the Army and was in an asylum at Dublin—they sent home to me to see if I would have him as a harmless lunatic and I took him home again—then he enlisted in another regiment—he was in the Army for over four years; he was in the South African war—from there he went to India, where he was for two years—it was ten or eleven years ago that he was in the asylum in Dublin—he was in Netley Hospital for three months after he had been in India—I did not see him there—then he came home, two years ago last July—he has been at home ever since—he was discharged from the Army owing to a little trouble, but I do not know what it was—that was two years ago—he was discharged from the Army to Wandsworth prison; I think it was for losing his kit—eleven months before that he was in Canterbury—he had two years there—I went to visit him there—I asked him how his head was then, and he said it was very bad—he came home last May and has been home chiefly since then—he has been helping me, turning the mangle and looking after the place when I was at work—I used to leave him in charge with his father—I never left him in charge alone—he has had ever so many attacks with his head—I have known him lie in bed for two or three days—when his mind was bad he never wrote letters—I cannot call it to mind that he has been under observation since he was in Dublin—he was in Southwark Infirmary for a fortnight and then they asked me to have him home again, which I did.

GUILTY . He then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction of felony at Newington Sessions, on December 10th, 1895. Four other convictions were proved against him. Three years' penal servitude."
Theft,"JAMES EDWARD BRANDON . I am a member of the firm of Wagner & Brandon, manufacturers and agents, of Aldermanburv Building, E.C.—Young had been in our service as porter for four years, carrying goods from one place to another—he had nothing to do with buying or selling—at the annual stocktaking on June 20th we missed about 100 hair nets—at the end of July we missed about six gross in one number, And when we took the stock at the beginning of October we missed thirty odd gross—in consequence of that on October 2nd I had a conversation with Young, and he made a confession to me—I sent for the police and gave him into custody—I afterwards went with the police to Freedman's small draper's shop in Crystal Palace Road, East Dulwich where I saw in the window some fringe nets—I spoke to a little girl who was passing, and after giving her some money she went into the shop—she brought out two hair nets in an envelope (Produced), one of them wrapped in this piece of tissue paper (Produced)—they are of the kind missed by me—she handed them to me—with detectives Marriott and Board I went into the shop—Marriot told Freedman that they were police officers; that they had the lad Young in custody, who had made a voluntary statement that he had taken a lot of nets belonging to Messrs. Wagner & Brandon; that Young had also made a confession that he had sold the goods to him (Freedman)—Freedman denied having had any hair nets from Young, but said that he had met a lad about ten months ago, he thought it was in Milton Street, and had had some conversation with him, but he had had no dealings with him since—the detectives said they would search his shop and see if he had any goods—we went through several boxes and in one of them I picked out eighteen hair nets which I identified as mine, principally by the packing and the length, which is a little longer than is usually made in this number; they are made abroad specially for me—according to my direction the mesh is a little larger than usual, and that is what makes it longer—also one of the nets is darker than is usual—I also found some tissue paper which is similar to the tissue paper in which one of the nets obtained by the little girl was wrapped—it was tissue paper that came over with the hair nets which I ordered from abroad—it has little squares in it which I have never seen in any other tissue paper—I had not used any of it, and no goods of mine which left my premises properly were wrapped up in it—he also produced these three stocking suspenders (Produced), which I identified as mine, as the attachment to the corset is my patent—when suspenders are properly sold from my premises they are wrapped up like this—when found in Freedman's shop they were loose—there is nothing to stop the purchaser unwrapping them—we had only sold three dozen of that particular number of suspender from March to June in London, and there was one house who put them on their pattern card last July; they sold a few dozen, but I feel sure they went to the country,

because only country travellers came—we sell our hair nets at about 32s. to 35s. a gross wholesale, getting about 10 per cent, profit.

Cross-examined. We have a very large business in these nets and we sell large quantities of them—I would not like to say we are the only makers of the particular length of those nets the little girl purchased—one of these nets is 63 to 64 centimetres and 40 to 42 meshes; you can get various quantities of meshes into 64 centimetres—40 to 42 meshes is not the universal length—I am not sure that that other net is ours—I do not identify them by the colour—I am not at all doubtful about the ones found in Freedman's shop; I only took those which I thought I could absolutely identify as my property—we sell about 200 or 300 gross in six months; we are wholesale and sell them to retailers in London, and they undoubtedly sell them to men in Freedman's position—we sell stocking suspenders to Rotheran's—I know there is an auction room in Milton street and it is possible that men in Freedman's position would buy job lots of haberdashery there—our customers employ Button's, the carriers, to fetch goods; they pay carriage—I know that a quantity of goods was lost by Sutton which was afterwards sold by Fryer & Cooper, but they were not nets—we employ a good many men and women workers in the factory and warehouse—I do not know of any other loss in hair nets but through Young; I can put my finger on no one else and we have dealt with it in every way possible—we suspect no one else—we had full faith in Young and he had the keys of the warehouse—when we went to Freedman's shop he had some of the nets in the window, ""which we asked him to produce—he said he had bought the goods at an auctioneer's; I think he mentioned the name of Fryer & Cooper, and he gave a catalogue to the detective—I have the particulars of what we lost through Sutton, and I have every reason to believe Young when he said he lost them—he lost them in Button's yard—we communicated with Sutton and they tried to trace them—it may have been that Young stole them—amongst them were twenty ""Trixy"" suspenders—I do not know whether the goods were sold; we have not recovered them—we might have sold 150 to 200 dozen of these suspenders in the country; they run from 4s. 6d. a dozen upwards—they are not articles that can be purchased on a barrow from a hawker; it may be possible, but I should say it is most exceptional—I cannot get hair nets at 14s. to 18s. a gross; you are thinking of the silk nets—I know Jacobs & Wolf, of Hounsditch, and I think they are in a large way of business—I should say the price of these nets which you say have been bought at their place (Produced) is from 24s. to 27s. a gross—ours are larger and of much better quality than these.

FREDERICK YOUNG . I am nineteen years of age—I have pleaded guilty to this indictment and am ready to tell the truth about the matter—I was a porter in the service of Wagner & Brandon and I took out parcels and goods for them—about fifteen months ago I was going along Milton Street from Featherstone Street with a parcel that had printed on it ""Ladies' fringe nets"" and the name and address of certain customers, when I met Freedman in company with two gentlemen outside

the auction rooms—he left them and stopped me as I was going along—he said, ""Does your master sell job lines?"" and I said, ""No, we sell to all the big firms in the City,"" and pointing to ""Tubbs & Hiscock's"" I said, ""We sell to that firm""—he said, ""Can you get any?""—I asked him what he meant, and he said, ""You know""—I said, ""All right; I will try""—he gave me his card, which had on it, ""Mr. Freedman, 112, Crystal Palace Road""; I am not quite sure whether it said what he was—I afterwards showed it to Mr. Hodson, and then tore it up—the prisoner promised me 10s. for one gross—the parcel I was carrying hat not the name of the firm on it—he asked me where I was employed and I told him ""Wagner & Brandon's, I, Aldermanbury Buildings""—he said, ""I will be here next Tuesday. Do not forget to meet me""—between that and the next Tuesday I got a gross of hair nets from the governor's drawer, of which I had the keys—I had stolen nothing before then—I met Freedman on the Tuesday at the same place and we both went to Basinghall Street, where I handed him the goods—he gave me 4s., and I said, ""Is this all?""—he said, ""I will give you the rest next time, as I am very short of cash. Do not forget to meet me next Tuesday, if you can""—the next Tuesday I met him at the same place with one more gross—we both went to Paper Street and he gave me 7s. for it—after that I took him some every other week—some weeks he gave me 5s. and some weeks 4s. 6d. and 4s.—on one occasion I got him two gross, when he gave me 10s.—the highest I have got for a gross is 7s.—I spent the money in getting good dinners and backing horses—I lost except once or twice—on the Tuesday before I was caught he said, ""I have got a special order for three gross, one light colour, one mid colour and one dark colour,"" and I told him I could not get him too many—the gross that I gave him that day was the last he had—I was caught on the next Monday, October 2nd—he never had the three gross—about three months ago he asked me once if we sold anything else and I said stocking suspenders, and he told me to fetch him a sample—I met him at Fryer & Cooper's and gave him eight, for which he gave me 3d. and Is. for myself—they are sold by my master at 4s. 6d. a dozen—at his request I went to his shop in Crystal Palace Road with nets about four times—Arthur Wadsworth, a friend of mine, came with me two or three times—I asked him to lend me 6d. for riding money, which he did, and when I got the money from Freedman I paid him Is., 6d. his expenses and 6d. I had borrowed—I asked him to come as a favour—he is eighteen years old and helps in a glass beveller's shop; I believe he is out of work now, but he was at Newton's then—we went by a train from Ludgate Hill—when I borrowed the sixpence it was eight or nine months ago—he has been with me since—we used to go on Thursdays, and the last time he came with me was about six weeks before August Bank Holiday—on Monday, October 2nd, I made a full confession to Mr. Brandon and since then I have been in prison—Wadsworth came to see me once in prison—I had 15s. wages—I sold Freedman about sixty gross altogether—six or seven weeks ago I sold about seven gross of nets to another man who had nothing to do with Freedman.

Cross-examined. I knew the difference between right and wrong when I met Freedman first; I had been three and a half years in Wagner & Brandon's employ—I believe that morning I had called at Tubbs & Hiscock's to see if they had any orders—the man whom I sold the other nets to was called Strutt—I made the statement before the Magistrate that I had sold Strutt seven gross, but that was not accepted and he was discharged—sometimes Strutt gave me 2s. 6d. and sometimes 3s. a gross, but they were only small nets—I am certain I sold to nobody else but him and Freedman—I lost two parcels at Button's—I do not know what they contained; I do not think it was suspenders, but haberdashery of some kind; I know there were some steels that go into ladies' stays—I do not know that they were afterwards sold at Fryer & Cooper's—as far as I know, there were no other goods lost through any other employes—I do not know that a great many other goods were lost and can be traced besides those that I was dealing with—I first told Wadsworth all about this two months ago, and he said he would not do it if he was me—I told no one in my master's employ till I told Mr. Brandon—I did not mention anything about Wadsworth in my statement, because I never thought of him until I saw him in the Police Court—I was not present when Freedman told Mr. Brandon and the detective that he had had no dealings with me; he once said to me, ""You have made a nice mess of it""—they did not say that if I made a statement I would notget much imprisonment—my master asked me to make it before I went to the detectives at all.

Re-examined. Wadsworth came to see me at the prison before I came up at the Police Court, to bring me some grub.

EDWARD MARRIOT (Detective, City). On October 2nd Young made a statement to me which I wrote down and he signed—in consequence of what he said on that day, I went to Freedman's place in Crystal Palace Road with Mr. Brandon and another officer—outside Mr. Brandon sent in a little girl, who brought out two nets in a little parcel—we went in and saw Freedman—I told him we were police officers and that we had got a lad in custody in the City who had made a statement in which he said that he had been in the habit of supplying him (Freedman) with a quantity of fringe nets—I then gave him an outline of the statement, in reply to which he said, ""I did speak to a boy in Milton Street. I noticed he had a large envelope with 'Fringe nets' on it. I asked him where he worked and he told me some name, but I forget. I then asked him if his master had any job lots""—I told him we were going to search his shop and he assisted us by fetching down some boxes—Mr. Brandon picked out eighteen hair nets and three stocking suspenders from various boxes—I asked Freedman how he accounted for the possession of the fringe nets, and he said, ""I bought them under the hammer either in Milton Street or Hounsditch a few months ago""—he said that he had bought the suspenders in a job lot at Fryer & Cooper's sale on July 11th this year, and at the same time he handed me this catalogue, dated July 11th (Produced)—there is no mention of suspenders in it and I have been right through it—Mr. Brandon said, ""These are my goods, and I am

going to give you into custody""—I asked Freedman if he had got any invoices for the fringe nets, and he looked through his papers—he showed me lots of papers, but nothing relating to fringe nets or suspenders—I took him to Moor Lane police station, where he was confronted with Young, whose statement was read to him, to which he said nothing (Read): ""I live at 25, Ashford Place, Walthamstow. About eighteen months ago I was in Milton Street with a parcel of fringe net envelopes. A man I know now by the name of Freedman and living at 152, Crystal Palace Road, stopped me and asked me if my governor sold any job lines. I said, 'No.' He then said, 'Can you get any?' I said, 'I will try.' He said, 'I will give you 10s. for a gross.' He then gave me his card with his name and address on. In a few days I got a gross, met him in Milton Street, and gave them to him. He gave me 4s. for them and promised me double the amount next time. The following week I got another gross, met him by arrangement at the same place, gave them to him, and he gave me 7s. I have given him a gross every other week since, the last time being last Tuesday. About seven weeks ago I took eight suspenders, for which he gave me 3d. On three occasions I have taken them (the nets) to his shop in Crystal Palace Road. I should think he has had about sixty gross altogether and has paid me at the rate of about 5s. per gross. About three weeks ago I was in conversation with Harry Strutt, who lives in the third house on the right in Hartley Crescent, Walthamstow. I told him I was working in the fringe net trade. He said, 'I know where to sell some if you get any.' I have got about seven gross at different times. He has paid me 3s. or 4s. a gross for them. F. YOUNG.""

Cross-examined. I did not warn Freedman before I asked him anything—I went with Young's statement, which is in my handwriting, in my pocket—I wrote it down from what he told me at the station—I made out a rough draft and then wrote it out fresh—I warned Young before he made it; I had had no conversation with Mr. Brandon then—I did not warn Freedman, because he was not in custody; I simply went to make inquiries—some hair nets were in the window—there were a very few nets indeed in the shop—there were eighteen identified and perhaps another eighteen which were not—there were only three suspended there—I did not hear him say in the presence of Brandon that he had had no dealings with Young—if I had heard him say it, it would have been in the note which I made at the time—it might have been said to Mr. Brandon at the other end of the shop; I put down everything I heard—I have made inquiries about Freedman and find that he has been carrying on an honest business; I cannot say for what length of time; we found nothing against him—my inquiries go back for three or four years—he took the catalogue from his jacket pocket, in which he had a number of other catalogues—I did not ask him for any accounts—I saw a number of slips like this (Auctioneer's account slip, produced)—I believe he has purchased goods from Fryer & Cooper; in fact he purchased two lots out of the catalogue of July 11th—I only made inquiries about the sale on July 11th.

Re-examined. He bought lots 205 and 211 in the July 11th catalogue—205 is ""Large box of sundries, a quantity of hoops, and a pair of stays,"" And 211, ""A tin trunk and contents, and a silk lamp shade.""

JAMES PACKER WAGNER . I am a partner in the firm of Wagner & Brandon—I have seen the nets and suspenders produced, and they are identical to the goods which we have in stock.

ARTHUR WADSWORTH . I am a labourer in a glass beveller's, but I am out of work at present—Young is a friend of mine—I have been to Crystal Palace Road with him three times, the first time about twelve months Ago—we went from Ludgate Hill to Peckham Bye and then got out and walked to 152, Crystal Palace Road, Mr. Freedman's place—Young paid the fares; he borrowed the money from me—he had a parcel with him—when he went inside the shop he gave it to Freedman, who put it under the counter—I was standing outside looking in at the window—Freedman paid Young some money at the door, but I could not see what it was—Young gave me the 1s. I lent him—this was on Thursday evening after I had done work—I left off at 7 p.m., and I met him about 7.20, getting to Crystal Palace Road at 8.15—each of the other two times I went with him he had a parcel which he gave to Freedman—it was only the first time that he borrowed money from me—the other two times were on a Thursday evening, and Freedman always paid him at the door; his shop was open.

Cross-examined. The last occasion I went was eight months ago; I cannot tell you the month—he always met me at 7.20 p.m.—I went with him a month before that and the first time was a month before that—I saw Young for the last time about two months ago at Walthamstow, standing at a greengrocer's stall in High Street; I did not speak to him—I went out with him as a friend two months after the last time I went to Crystal Palace Road—it was a small brown paper parcel tied up with white string—I never went into Freedman's shop—I could see through the window there were some goods in it—the first time I went Mrs. Freedman came and spoke to Freedman—I did not notice any customers in the shop on any of the occasions—I was asked last Thursday by Mr. Marriot to give evidence here—I visited Young in prison last Wednesday—I heard that he had been arrested on the Monday evening a fortnight ago; his sister came and told me—I took him some food—I did not mention this to anybody from the last time I went to Crystal Palace Road until that Wednesday—Mr. Marriot asked me to go to Mr. Myers to give evidence against the prisoners—I read about it in the paper—Marriot said, ""Be careful and speak the truth""—I only knew from the papers that Young was charged with theft.

Re-examined. I made a statement to Mr. Myers, which was taken down in writing—it was read over to me and I signed it.

EDWARD MARRIOT (Further cross-examined by MR. DRAKE). I visited Freedman's shop on two occasions—I do not know whether it is possible to see through the window of the shop into the shop—there were a large number of articles of wearing apparel hanging in the window.

Freedman, in his defence on oath, said true it was true he had met a boy,

whom he supposed was Young, about a year ago, and had asked him whether his master had any job lots to sell, but that the rest of Young's statement was totally untrue; that he had not bought any hair nets nor suspenders from him and had not met Young since that day at all; that he had been in business as a small draper for over eighteen years and had not had any charge made against him; that it was his custom to buy haberdashery in job lots at Fryer & Cooper's auction rooms and at the Milton Street auction rooms; that he had bought the hair nets found in his shop at a sale at Fryer & Cooper's of goods unclaimed at carriers, Suttons being one, on August 12th; the catalogue made no mention of hair nets, but they, being of such small value, were not catalogued as a separate article; that it was impossible for anyone to identify hair nets as their own, as he could procure them of the same size and colour as the prosecutors' at any wholesale shop; that he had bought the suspenders from Rotheran & Company, it being possible to obtain similar articles at any wholesale shop; that he had never seen Wadsworth in his life; that he and Young never came to his shop, nor did he pay Young anything on any of the occasions alleged, and that it was his custom to close his shop at five on Thursdays.

Evidence for the Defence.

ELIZABETH COLLINS . I reside in East Dulwich and have five daughters—I have been a customer of Freedman for some eight or nine years—I purchased these five pairs of suspenders (Produced) in the Westmoreland Road, Camberwell, giving 3d. a pair for them.

JOHN RAWSON . I am manager of the auction company that carry on business at 48, Milton Street, our principal business being in haberdashery and soft goods generally—we hold auctions every Tuesday and Thursday—Freedman has been attending them for seven or eight years, buying haberdashery mostly—we sold fringe nets when such stocks came by containing them—if there were not sufficient nets we would not specify them—Freedman has purchased pretty largely of that kind of goods—we have always given him accounts, which he has paid—the average price of hair nets is about 3s. or 3s. 6d. a gross—it is possible to get any quantity required in our rooms.

By the COURT. Customers have to pay before clearing the goods—we give them two days in which to clear them.

Cross-examined. I have a full knowledge of drapery—I know that a silk or hair net is different to a cotton one—nets vary in quality and some are very much more expensive than others—it would not matter whether they were cheap or otherwise; if there were not sufficient for one lot we should put it with other articles and call it ""A quantity of haber dashery""—we generally get bankrupt stock, but we buy salvage at times—we could not possibly sort hair nets out into their different qualities; they would all go in together.

SAMUEL BURDEN (By the JURY). I am a warder at Brixton prison—when a prisoner is awaiting trial he can be visited any day—a warder is present to keep order, but not to listen, and there are too many talking to enable him to hear much that is said.

FREEDMAN GUILTY — Twelve months' hard labour. YOUNG— six months, hard labour."
Deception,"MARY BUTCHER . I am an assistant at the Fulham Post Office, 132, Lillie Road—this book was issued to the prisoner on August 2nd last—the account was opened by a payment of 3s.—I wrote in this amount of 3s.—the words as I wrote them are not here in this book now; they have been inked over—they were written first of all with a fine pen—the name of the depositor was written at the time by the prisoner.

LUCY HARRIET BUTCHER . I am sub-postmistress at the Fulham Post Office, Lillie Road—on August 16th the prisoner came into the Post Office and produced her book—she wished to make a deposit of 3s. only.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. I did not see you put an extra 4s. down on the counter.

BEN POTTER . I am sub-postmaster at the Northfleet Lane Post Office, West Ealing—I remember the prisoner coming in and saving she wished to withdraw some money—this withdrawal notice was handed to me—the amount is 10s.—that was signed by the prisoner—the book when I received it showed 16s. to her credit—I entered the 10s. on the debit side—according to the regulations the prisoner would sign her name on an envelope for the return of the book, which has to be sent to the General Post Office—it was signed by the prisoner—I did not at that time notice any change in the writing in the book—I can see now by looking at it closely that there has been an alteration.

The prisoner. ""I did not sign the envelope; some little girl addressed that. I got the 10s. from that gentleman.""

WILLIAM ALBERT CHRISTY . I am a clerk in the Savings Bank Department—I produce a correct copy of the prisoner's account—this shows 3s. paid in on August 2nd and 3s. on August 16th.

JOHN DUNCAN . I am a clerk in the Secretary's Department at the Post Office—I investigated this matter—I spoke to the prisoner about the withdrawal of 10s.—I cautioned her beforehand—I asked her what amount she had deposited on August 16th—she said, ""I put 3s. in first and then I got 3s. or 4s. afterwards to make up a little more""—I then asked her if she had made the withdrawal of the 10s.—she said ""Yes, I did; the gentleman gave me 10s.; it was all I had but 1s. I left in the account""—I showed her the book and asked her if she had altered the entries—she said, ""Me? Oh, no, I never touched the book; I never did such a thing in my life. I would have been too frightened to do such a thing""—she said the writing on the cover was hers, but not the signatures on the form; a little girl who was with her wrote the signatures—she said the little girl was a stranger to her—she said, ""I don't know her; she is in the country now, but I do not know where; she was only staying at Ealing, where I was for a week, a few doors away from the house where I was staying, at No. 16, Trent Avenue""—I asked her if she asked the little girl to write the signatures on the form—she said ""No,"" but the little girl had said to her, ""Shall I write it for you?"" and she had said, ""I don't mind""—that was all that took place.

The prisoner. ""Every word that he says I said to him is correct.""

RALPH COLDICOTT (Detective G.P.O.) I was present at the interview described by the last witness—I heard his evidence just now—it is correct—I took the prisoner into custody.

The prisoner's defence. ""I never altered the book and I will take my oath I put that money on the counter, as I had to go away for a fortnight.""

Evidence for the Defence.

MRS. RUBLEY. The prisoner lived with me for about four years—she was in my service as servant for about two years, and after that I let her a room for about two years—I became in straightened circumstances and could not keep her any longer—I always found her honest and hard-working—she has always been in service.

Cross-examined. She was living in my house in August last—I believe she did have money in the savings bank—I have always found her very quiet and very sober—I never saw her intoxicated.

GUILTY . Discharged on her own recognisances in £5."
Deception,"ERNEST LIDSTONE . I am a clerk at 4, Jewry Street, Aldgate—I ordered goods of Messrs. Johnston & Laird,.37, Fenchurch Street, to the value of £1 17s. 6d.—I paid on the order a deposit of 10s.—on June 23rd I paid the balance of £1 7s. 6d. to the prisoner—he gave me this receipt.

WILLIAM BENNETT . I am a clerk at 19, St. Dunstan's Place—I ordered goods from Johnston & Laird in May, 1906—I paid a deposit of 10s. a week and paid 5s. a week up to June 24th to the prisoner—he gave me this receipt.

JOHN NICHOLL COOK . I am an engineer at 64, Mark Lane—I ordered goods from Johnston & Laird, 37, Fenchurch Street, for £4 2s. 6d.—I paid that account on July 4th to the prisoner—he gave me this receipt.

ERNEST GEORGE SAWYER . I am a clerk at 33, Mark Lane—I ordered goods of Johnston & Laird for £7 3s.-—on July 7th I paid the account to the prisoner—this is the receipt.

ALFRED BATES . I am a clerk at 22, Virginia Road, Bethnal Green—I ordered clothing from Johnston & Laird in June last for £2 5s., which I paid to the prisoner—he gave me a receipt—it was paid by cash.

FREDERICK GEORGE PAINTER . I am a chartered accountant at 19, Coleman Street—the prosecutor and the prisoner both attended before me with the prosecutor's books upon, I think, four occasions—the prisoner pointed out to me accounts which have been paid, and which he had not accounted for—the total sum which he admitted had been paid and not accounted for by him was £111 16s.—he admitted that wages had been drawn by him to the amount of £24 6s. 3d. in respect to what have been described as bogus orders—I went into the question of the bogus orders and the prosecutor and the prisoner agreed that £97 11s. was the amount of the fictitious orders—upon that state of the account it would show that the prosecutor had lost £38 11s. 3d.—there was a claim made by the prisoner that there was a further sum of £53 11s. 6d. of bogus orders, which claim the prosecutor refused to admit—if that had been admitted it would have shown he had paid money out of his own pocket to the employer—upon the state of accounts set up by the prisoner he has overpaid the prosecutor £15 0s. 3d.

Cross-examined. I have had considerable experience as an accountant—I knew that some charge was pending at the Mansion House—I was

selected by the Alderman who heard the case to go in the ordinary way into the accounts between the prosecutor and the prisoner—there was a solicitor on both sides present—I treated it as if it were an ordinary commercial dispute between two merchants—the prosecutor attended as a sort of plaintiff, and the prisoner as a defendant—the witnesses were not sworn—there was evidence on both sides—having got the figures and the statement of each party, I drew my deductions in figures—I was called as a witness for the prosecution at the Mansion House.

Re-examined. There are two wars, no doubt, of arriving at the balance due to the prosecutor of £38 11s. 3d.—I think the result is the same.

JAMES MCCOMBIE . I am a tailor, trading as Johnston & Laird at 37, Fenchurch Street—the prisoner has been about four years in my service at various branches—in September, 1904, I appointed him manager of the 37, Fenchurch Street, branch—it was his duty to keep the Cash Book and to enter in it the amounts received from customers, and to send me a daily sheet containing various matters, and amongst them orders received from customers—on looking at the Cash Book I find on June 23rd, 1905, that there is no entry of £1 7s. 6d. paid by Mr. Lidstone—the prisoner has never accounted to me for that money—on July 7th there is no entry of £7 3s. paid by Mr. Sawyer—the prisoner has never accounted for that—on July 4th there is no entry of £4 2s. 6d. paid by Mr. Cook—the prisoner has never accounted for that—I have searched the Cash Book and do not find anywhere the name of Alfred Bates—the prisoner has never accounted to me for £2 5s. paid by Mr. Bates in June—I find an entry of 5s. received on June 3rd from Mr. Bennett, but no entry of the balance of £1 7s. 6d. received—the prisoner has never accounted to me for that money—on looking at the daily sheet for June 23rd, which is in the prisoner's writing I find no entry of £1 7s. 6d. paid by Mr. Lidstone—I find no entry in the sheet of July 6th of £4 2s. 6d. paid by Mr. Cook, no entry in the sheet of July 7th of £7 3s. 6d. paid by Mr. Sawyer—it was the prisoner's duty to enter all payment upon these sheets—there is no entry in the daily sheets of £1 7s. 6d. paid by Mr. Bennett on June 24th—there is no entry in the sheets of the name of Bates nor of the moneys paid by Bennett—in sending in the sheets it was the prisoner's duty to send in the cash as well, also to send in a statement of the amount required for tailors' wages required from time to time—on looking at the sheet for April 10th, 1905, there is an order on it, No. 3056, and against that is 11s. 6d. wages required—on June 17th there is a statement upon the sheet of wages required to pay on order, 3718, of 9s. 6d.—in those cases and in other cases where tailors' wages were called for, I sent the money to pay them—I had stock taken on the last day of July, and a few days afterwards found a state of things which called for inquiry—I found, for instance, a number of persons to whom credit had been given, who had no addresses in the book, and that there was a good deal of money outstanding apparently due from customers—I asked the prisoner to explain—on August 12th he showed me a book called the Outstanding Debt Book—my business is a cash one and there should be on the premises goods representing the orders which have not been paid for and not delivered—

I took the Outstanding Debt Book and went through it item by item with him—I asked him to account for so many outstanding debts, and he said he had put through false orders—to prove that, I went to the Tailors' Wages Book, expecting to find them not paid for, but I found they were paid—he said, ""I drew the tailors' money only to help to pay these false orders""—I asked him to give me a list of what he said were false orders, which he did—he also gave me a list of the customers' payments—it shows a total of £98 2s. 6d.—underneath is written, ""To the best of my knowledge the above is an accurate record of the customers that have paid me for goods supplied by Johnston & Laird""—I do not know what the object was of sending bogus orders—he could only receive the tailors' wages on them—it would make the business appear bigger than it actually was—Bennett's order was claimed by the prisoner as a bogus one—Gurney was another—Vernon is another—they are both here as witnesses—Redgrove is another—he is in Court; also Turner—the goods have gone out in respect of £53—I have suffered a loss in consequence of the prisoner's conduct.

Cross-examined. I have ten tailors' establishments, of which I am the sole proprietor—eight are earned on in the name of McCombie—I trade in Kilburn in the name of Bradshaw—I am finishing nine months of a lease under that name—my name there of McCombie was taken down, and then I found I had to go on and put up the name of Bradshaw—I have another shop in Fenchurch Street in my own name—it is very near the other one, which is in the name of Johnston & Laird—it is not quite the same class of business—I did not want the books at No. 37 to show as much turnover as possible—I can see no benefit to the prisoner from the bogus orders—I have never had a dispute with a fellow tradesman referred to arbitration—I should think my solicitors had the result of Mr. Painter's investigation—the prisoner was originally charged with embezzlement, but was not committed on that—the indictment here has to do with my counsel—I am the prosecutor and responsible for the prisoner's arrest—I dispute the bogus orders—I do not dispute Mr. Painter's figures.

Re-examined. As to the £53, the goods have gone out of my establishment in respect of it—I know that the £97 claimed as bogus orders was not, in fact, bogus orders—I have never been convicted of burglary or any other offence—I am the unfortunate person who is an employer—my lease at Kilburn had expired and everything was taken down, including the name; I then found I had to go on because I could not get a tenant oft the premises, and so continued the business for a short period under another name to cover my loss—the matter when at the Mansion House Police Court was in counsel's hands.

WILLIAM NEWELL (Detective-Sergeant, City). I arrested the prisoner on September 14th at Yukon Road, Balham—I showed him a receipt for £4 2s. 6d. and asked him if it was in his writing—he said, ""Yes""—I told him he would be charged with stealing and embezzling that amount—he said, ""I have received the money, but I explained all that to Mr. McCombie""—when charged he made no reply.

Cross-examined. I had no difficulty in finding him.

GUILTY . He was given a good character. The Jury added, ""We think that the Prosecution is somewhat to blame in allowing books to be kept in such a dilapidated condition."" Judgment respited."
Breaking Peace,"JANE MURRHY . I live with my father at 17, Love Lane, Shadwell—the prisoner is my first cousin—last March we were keeping company, but we were not engaged to be married; he had asked me to marry him and I had said yes, but the death of my sister had prevented it from being carried out—in August I saw him and told him I would have no more to do with him—since then he has been down several times to my house and has told me that rather than me have anybody else he would sooner do for me—on one occasion he showed me a carving knife, which he took from a drawer in the house and said, ""I will kill you""—I know his writing—I received several letters from him, some of which I have destroyed—on November 2nd I received this letter from him: ""Dear Janie,—These few lines to you which I must write. I am now going to do my duty and carry my words out the first chance I get. I can see now that you mean to part from me, which I consider you have been persuaded, so therefore you will suffer for others' advice. I am left entirely to the world and have got no friends, so I am sure I do not wish to live any longer myself, and I am not going to make an end of myself unless I serve it on you first, which I have thoroughly, made up my mind to do, and I must do it. I will watch every movement until I get the chance, and the sooner it comes the better, for I am alone, but the Lord will forgive me for my doings. George. If I break in the house I will do it""—on November 8th I received this letter: ""Janie, I am going now to do what I said. This is the last letter I shall write, but if I cannot

catch you out I will do it through the kitchen grating, but will take care I shall do myself in as well, but if it is six months more you shall not escape me. I mean it this time; daylight or night I will have you, so you can make sure of it before you shall have another. George""—after that I was very nervous and afraid to go out alone—I applied for a warrant, and the day I had to go to the Police Court I got this letter from the prisoner: ""Janie, I hear that your father has been looking for me, but I am looking for you, and the more it goes on like this the worse it will be. I am going to do what I say to you and nobody shall stop it, but there is plenty of time for you and me, so prepare yourself. I shall have you in this way. G.""

By the COURT. He does not live near me; he lives at Hackney—I do not think he is in regular employment; he has been out of work for some time—I have not seen him since November 1st—it is two or three months ago that he first wrote me a letter like this—I received two or three letters every week, but not all threatening—some were threatening and some were forgiving—since August he has not followed me and has not done anything to me—the last time he came was after I had received the first letter and I shut the door in his face, and he has done nothing since except write letters.

DAISY TILBURY . I live with my husband at 19, Belgrave Street, Stepney—I know the prisoner and I remember the time when the engagement between Miss Murphy and himself was broken off—he has spoken to me about it; I have often been in his company—he said he thought a lot of her and that before anyone else should have her he would settle her or kill her—he said that twice, once on a Sunday evening, when he said he would kill her to-morrow—he always said that he would kill himself as well.

ALBERT HELSON (Detective Sergeant H.) I arrested the prisoner on November 10th on a warrant, which I read to him—he said, ""I did not mean to do it""—I took him to the police station and charged him and he made the same reply—I searched him and found this razor and this knife upon him—the knife is new.

The prisoner's defence. ""There was nothing I meant at all. I did not mean to do it; I swear, on my oath, I did not. I did not think anything of it. I did not know I was doing anything wrong. I did not think anything of the letters I had written; if I had thought anything of them I should not have sent them or written them.""

GUILTY . Recommended to mercy by the Jury on the ground that they did not think he intended to kill. Six months in the Second Division."
Royal Offences,"ELVINA SHERE . I am employed at the Builder's Arms, Grundy Street, E.—on October 31st, about 4.45 p.m., I was in the bar when the prisoner came in and called for two-pennyworth of rum cold—he tendered in payment a 2s. piece—I did not like the look of it, but said nothing and gave him his change—I put the coin on one side to show my master—about ten minutes afterwards he came in and called for another two-pennyworth of rum—before I served him he laid down another 2s. piece—I picked it up and compared it with the other one and said to him, ""You are passing bad money""—he said, ""You're a liar""—I said, ""I shall detain you and we will see who is telling the truth""—before that I had said

to him, ""Here is your glass, I will serve you in that""—I had not removed his glass that he had used before—he did not answer—I gave him the rum in the same glass—I examined the coins and found them very smooth and I looked at my thumb and saw it was black—a policeman was sent for—I have seen the prisoner before as a customer.

THOMAS STRICKLAND . I am a baker, living in the neighbourhood of the Builder's Arms—on October 31st I was in the house and saw the prisoner there twice—I saw him served twice—I saw him give the barmaid a 2s. piece each time.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. I was watching all the time—I saw a constable come in—he searched you—I did not see the constable take down a statement from you.

Re-examined. All the constable found was 2d. on the floor, nothing on the man.

By the COURT. Ten minutes elapsed between the prisoner's drinks.

ALBERT SAWYER (680 K.) On October 31st I was called to the public-house—the prosecutor accused the prisoner of uttering two coins—he said, ""He came in about 4.45 and called for two-pennyworth of rum cold; she served him and he gave a 2s. piece for the first two-pennyworth of rum; she gave him change; he then left the house and came back about ten minutes after; he then offered another 2s. piece and the barmaid told him she thought they were bad; the prisoner in reply said, ""It's a lie; I have not been out of the house. I have not got a farthing on me""—I asked him where he got the coins from—he said, ""I got them from Jack Wild, 14, Bedford Street, Canning Town. I worked for him last week; he paid me two 2s. pieces, half-a-crown, a shilling and a sixpence""—I searched the prisoner and found on him 9d. in his right-hand vest pocket—there was no money on the floor—Sergeant Lee made the inquiries about Bedford Street.

Cross-examined. I did not take the statement down in the public-house—I wrote it in my notebook when I got to the station—I did not come to the cell and ask you questions—you were not drunk—I should say you were sober.

GEORGE WILD . I am a stevedore and work with my brother, Jack Wild—I know the prisoner—twelve months ago he worked for me and between seven and eight months since he worked for my brother.

By the COURT. He was a pretty good worker and we had no fault to find with him.

The prisoner. ""I never said I worked for this man.""

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER . I am Inspector of Coin at His Majesty's Mint—both these coins are bad—they are of the same mould.

---- LEE (Police Sergeant). I went to Canning Town to make inquiries—I did not find a Jack Wild—I found Mr. George Wild at 66, Vernon Street—there is no Bedford Street in Canning Town.

GEORGE WILD (Re-examined by the COURT). I know the jobs that go on in the Thames—I know my brother's jobs as well as my own—there is no other Jack Wild there.

The prisoner, in his defence, admitted passing the coins, but said that he did not know they were bad; that he had used the public-house for the last twenty-five years; that he had been a householder for twenty-five years; that he had been working in Poplar and Limehouse for thirty years; and had been thirty-three years a member of a Trades Union.

GUILTY . Three convictions were proved against him. The police stated that he had been in employment as a casual hand and that there was no complaint against him except drunken habits. He received a good character as a hard-working man. Three months' hard labour."
Theft,"FRANK LAMB . I am assistant to J. F. Bravington, pawnbroker, 27 and 29, Wardour Street—I have seen Gibbard before August 9th, when he pawned 1,000 cigars for £10—this is my memorandum, which I made out before I went to the Police Court—they were redeemed later—this is the contract note (G. A. Gibbard for C. Weingott)—on August 19th Gibbard again pledged 1,000 cigars for £7 in the name of Gibbard for Weingott—these were redeemed on September 25th.

Cross-examined. On August 9th and 19th Gibbard brought a letter in an envelope from Weingott (Asking for the advance on the cigars)—he handed me the note and the parcel, and said he came from Weingott—I did not know Weingott—I had received goods from him previously—I knew he was connected with the tobacco trade.

Re-examined. I do not think I should have advanced to Gibbard without a note, because his appearance would not justify it—he did not look as though he dealt in cigars—the notepaper has the address and the words, ""Cigar dealer"" on it.

WILLIAM GROSVENOR . I am assistant to Mr. Brooks, pawnbroker, of Wardour Street—on September 1st Gibbard came and said he had come from Mr. Weingott to pledge some cigars—I asked him what authority

he had—he said he had no authority, and that Mr. Weingott had sent him—he left 1,700 cigars in 33 boxes—he showed me this authority from Weingott—I said I would rather see Mr. Weingott, the principal in the matter—the next morning Weingott came with him—I did not know him before then—I think I saw Weingott three times altogether—some receipts were brought, which I looked at—I advanced £18 on the cigars—this is the contract note, which is signed ""G. A. Gibbard for C. Weingott""—I think Weingott could not have been present then—the address is ""2, Victoria Villas, Fortis Green""—those 1,700 cigars in 33 boxes were redeemed on September 15th—I have marked it at the back of the agreement.

Cross-examined. Gibbard handed me a note which was enclosed in an envelope—I opened it and told him I should require some invoices—I did not advance the money to Gibbard.

JAMES OFFREDI . I am a waiter and live at 126, Wardour Street—I know Hughes and Townsend—in September Townsend handed me five pawnbrokers' contract notes to dispose of, in consequence of which I sent them by post to Mr. Elman—each of these notes are for 1,000 cigars—two similar notes for 1,000 cigars each were Bravington's or Brooks'—Townsend paid me—I handed the money to Townsend, and deducted money for my trouble.

SAMUEL ELMAN . I am a jeweller—I live at Kenilworth House, Milton Street, W. C.—in September, or some time after, I got a letter from a man I know as Hughes through the last witness, Offredi, which contained five pawnbrokers' contract notes, for altogether something over 4,000 cigars—I handed those notes to Mr. Levoi—I got nothing out of the transaction.

MICHAEL LEVOI . I received from Samuel Elman some time in September five pawnbrokers' contract notes—I handed them to Mr. Van Raalte, who purchased them for £2 10s.—he took the cigars out of pawn—I was not there, but I went one day with him to look at them—he handed me samples, which I took to Mr. Harwood, who keeps the Adam and Eve public-house in the Euston Road, and on Van Raalte's behalf I sold the cigars to Mr. Harwood for £44 15s.—I had my commission—the cigars which Mr. Harwood purchased were the cigars mentioned in the five contract notes that I had received from Mr. Elman.

WILLIAM HARDWOOD . I am the proprietor of the Adam and Eve public-house, Euston Road—on September 27th I bought from Mr. Van Raalte 4,000 cigars through Mr. Levoi, for which I paid him £44 15s. by cheque—this is the receipt (Produced)—some of them were a small size and some a larger size—they consisted of 2,500 Ramont Carillo, 200 Padro Murias, 300 J. S. Murias, 300 Romeo and Julieta, 300 Coronas, and 400 Henry Clays.

HENRY DAVID BROWN . I am an accountant in the service of Messrs. Hatch Mansfield & Co., Limited, 15, Cockspur Street, wine merchants—they have also a cigar department—Weingott was one of their buyers—he had an office there for that purpose and was paid a salary at the commencement of his engagement at £3 per week and afterwards at £4 per

week, and a commission for all introductions—on the night of September 25th their premises were broken into, and a very large number of cigars were missed—upon the stock-taking there were missed about 13,000 cigars—this is the list produced—we put the matter in the hands of the police—I have examined the whole of the 4,000 cigars in the possession of Mr. Harwood—they are similar, in brand and mark, to those missing from our stock between June 30th and September 25th—on the stocktaking on June 30th everything was all right—I did not know Gibbard—I did hear that Weingott was employed by Newman & Co.

Cross-examined. Weingott is known in the tobacco trade—he has had practically the control of the selling at Hatch, Mansfield & Co's.—it was not known there that he had dealings on his own account—it is not usual in the trade for persons in a responsible position in a firm to do business on their own account—Weingott's duty was to give his whole services to the company—I do not know an instance of anyone in a similar position doing business on his own account privately.

Re-examined. Weingott was paid a weekly salary—he was expected to devote all his time to the company—the first time I knew of his having any dealings on his own was from the detective, I think, after this case arose.

SIDNEY ALBERT DAWES . I am a commissionaire employed by Hatch, Mansfield & Co., of 15, Cockspur Street—I have been in their employment since March, 1904—Weingott was a buyer for the firm—if anyone called to see him they would see me first—I have seen Gibbard fairly often, about a dozen times—he came to see Weingott—I always fetched Weingott to him—Gibbard said he came from Hunter & Wilcher, tobacconists—I showed him into Weingott's private room—no one else was in that room—so far as I know they would be alone together.

Cross-examined. I showed Gibbard into Weingott's private room each time he came—it was really a cigar room, and not a room into which people are shown as a matter of course—there is an outer office where I sit—Weingott always went into the cigar office—there would be no secrecy about Gibbard seeing Weingott.

Re-examined. Weingott would sometimes see Gibbard in the room downstairs and sometimes upstairs—stores were kept in both those rooms.

ABRAHAM VAN RAALTE . I am a cigar merchant of Lisle Street, Leicester Square—in September Levoi showed me these contract notes for 4,000 cigars, which had been pawned at Messrs. Bravingtons and at Messrs. Brooks, of Wardour Street—I went with Levoi to see the cigars at the pawnbrokers—I eventually bought the contract notes for £2 10s.—I took some of the 4,000 cigars out of pawn and some were taken out by my order—we looked at the cigars before they were bought—I gave them to Levoi to sell for me—practically Levoi bought them to sell to Harwood, but on my invoice—I think the cigars cost me £43 9s. 6d. end I sold them for £44 15s.—I had to pay £4 to the pawnbrokers and interest—I lost a small amount over the transaction.

EDWARD MONTAGUE LEWIS . I travel in cigarettes, and live at 74, Wardour Street—I know Weingott—I saw him on September 12th or 13th, when be gave me a contract note for thirty-three boxes of cigars supposed to contain 1,700 cigars—I redeemed the cigars in Wardour Street—they were 1,000 J. S. Murias, 200 Villa Villas and 500 Legitimidad.

HENRY DAVID BROWN . I have seen 1,700 cigars in thirty-three boxes in the possession of Lewis—they correspond with the cigars I missed from stock, the taking of which was taken between June 30th and September 25th.

THOMAS TAPPENDEN (Detective-Sergeant A.) Gibbard was in my custody at Marlborough Mews police station on October 3rd—I cautioned him—he made a statement in writing, in the course of which he says, ""The note shown to me by Sergeant Tappenden is the one Weingott gave me""—this is the note produced.

Cross-examined. I was present when Weingott was brought in—he made a statement to me before I took him to the police station—the only time Weingott saw Gibbard was when they were charged—I did not hear Weingott say, ""What are you going to charge this man with?"" nor ""I have deceived him"" or anything like it—Inspector Fuller took the charge—he is here—I did not hear Fuller say, ""I do not disbelieve what you say, but he is connected with the case, therefore I must hold him in custody""—I knew Weingott's position in the firm of Hatch, Mansfield & Co.—I know now that his name is well known in the tobacco trade—I have seen the documents produced, at the head of one of which he is described as a cigar importer and merchant—I believe he is respectably connected—I believe Gibbard did say that he thought the goods were the property of Weingott and that he had a right to sell them, and that if he had thought there was anything wrong he would not have touched them, or something to that effect.

Re-examined. Weingott's father is well known in the trade.

ROBERT FULLER (Inspector A.) On October 3rd I saw Gibbard near Argyle Place—he made a statement, which was taken down by Sergeant Tappenden—I do not recollect his saying anything else, apart from what was reduced to writing—he was taken to Marlborough Mews police station when he made his statement—he and Weingott were charged together—Weingott said something exculpating Gibbard, the substance of which was, ""What he has done he has done at my suggestion; he did not know that I had stolen them.""

Cross-examined. The words might have been, ""What are you going to charge this man with? He is innocent of what he has done; I have deceived him""—I did not say, ""I do not disbelieve what you say, but he is connected with the case, and therefore I must detain him in custody""—I did not hold any argument; I listened to what he had to say.

Gibbard, in his defence on oath, said that he agreed to pledge some of Weingott's cigars, believing them to be his own; that some of the cigars were left at the Charing Cross South Eastern Railway cloak room, because Weingott brought them from his home at Fortis Green; that he had no reason to think that Weingott was stealing cigars, or he would not have touched them;

and that he believed he and his family were highly respectable. GIBBARD

NOT GUILTY ."
Theft,"CHARLES HENLEY . I am a stoker on the Hampshire at Portsmouth, and am in London on leave—on December 4th, in the evening, I met the prisoners in a public-house and they invited me home to supper at their house at 22c, Storey Street—one of them recognised me as an old school-fellow and I recognised him—I had this bag with me (Produced), containing some clothes—after I had been at the house I went out to get some drink and paid for it, and when I came back I could not see my bag—I asked the prisoners about it and they said they knew nothing of it and I had not Drought anything in with me—they struck me, and I have got a black eye now—I went for a constable, who came back with me, and the prisoners told him that I had never brought anything in with me—I saw the constable find my clothes in the back room under the bed—I followed him in—when the prisoners struck me I took my own part.

Cross-examined by Ackerman. I took the bundle into the house myself—when your wife came in I did not touch her; you did not say, ""What are you doing?""and I did not knock your head through a window, and we did not go downstairs and have a fight for three or four minutes—Gutteridge is my old schoolfellow.

JAMES SAREN (260 Y.) On December 4th the prosecutor came to me and made a complaint and I went with him to 22c, Storey Street, Islington—I asked the prisoners for the bag of clothes which belonged to Henley and they both said they had not seen one—I asked them if they had any

other room than the one I was in and they both replied there was no other room—Gutteridge went away to another room on the same floor at the back—when he went in he looked under the bed—I also looked and saw some clothing there—I told the prisoners I should take them into custody for an assault upon the prosecutor and stealing the clothing—Gutteridge said, ""You do not want to make a d—fuss about a job of this kind""—Ackerman was the worse for drink, but Gutteridge was sober—the prosecutor was then perfectly sober.

By the COURT. Ackerman was not incapable and I should not describe him as very drunk, but he had had more than was good for him—I think I said at the station that they had been both drinking and Ackerman was the more drunk of the two.

C. HENLEY. (Recalled). I did not go into the back room at all and I did not know that that room was in Gutteridge's occupation—the only room I knew of was the front room.

Ackerman's statement before the Magistrate: ""We stood in the road and had a fair fight.""

Evidence for Ackerman.

ANNIE ACKERMAN . I am the prisoner's wife, and on this Monday night I went to meet my husband at 5.40—he is a coal porter—on the way home we had a few drinks and went into the Pembroke Arms, when the prosecutor came in and called for a soda—he turned round to my husband and said he had been drinking since 9 a.m.—he put his kit on the ground at my feet and asked my husband if he would have a drink—he turned to Gutteridge and said, ""Don't I know you?""who said, ""Yes""—they had a few words and called for two pots of ale—the governor in the bar said he did not think they required two pots and he gave them one pot and gave me some whisky—we went out and I picked up the sailor's kit and carried it out—he said, ""Come into the Salisbury,"" and my husband said, ""No, I am tired""—the sailor asked where we lived and I said the second house—we went home and I am not sure when we got upstairs if I put the kit on the foot of my bed in the front room—the sailor gave me 3s. to get some supper and he and Gutteridge went out and got some more drink, my husband being asleep in the chair—when the sailor, and Gutteridge came back the sailor caught me round the waist and kissed me—my husband got up and said, ""Don't take no liberties with my wife""—they had a bit of a struggle and the sailor went to hit me, and instead of doing that his head went through the window—they went downstairs and had a fair fight—I got my husband upstairs, when in comes the sailor and a policeman—Gutteridge walked out of my room then and the policeman followed him, and the kit was found under the bed—I do not know how it got there—the policeman saw Gutteridge unlock the door, but I did not—nobody else except the prosecutor, the prisoners and myself, were in the room except my little children.

J. SAREN (260 y.) (Re-examined by the COURT). The key of Gutteridge's room was in the lock outside—the door was locked—he turned the key and walked in.

Gutteridge's defence. ""I do not know how the key came there at all. The key was in the door when I came home from doing half a day's work.

ACKERMAN NOT GUILTY . GUTTERIDGE GUILTY . He then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction of felony at Clerkenwell Sessions on August 9th, 1904. Two other convictions were proved against him. The police stated that he was a very violent man and associated with convicts. Twelve months' hard labour."
Breaking Peace,"GEORGE COCKCROFT . I am a labourer, of 30, Conder Street, Stepney—on December 6th, between 4 and 5 p.m., I was walking down Repton Street, Limehouse, when I saw a sailor walking in the road—he had had a drop of drink—I saw three men following up behind—the prisoners are two of them—the third man went up to the sailor and fetched him back and took him to a little narrow way—Hunter then caught hold of him from behind and held both his hands—the third man, who is not here, went down the man's pockets—Hunter then let the sailor go and gave him a punch in the eye—Gownlock came over and took his silk handkerchief off his neck and went down his coat pocket—the three of them then ran off and left the prosecutor lying on the sidewalk—I went and picked him up and took him to a policeman, told him what had happened, and gave information at the police station—next day I picked out the two prisoners—I have known them for some months—the prosecutor was knocked senseless.

Cross-examined by Gownlock. I said before that I had seen you every day for twelve months—I have done so on and off for months.

By the COURT. I am sure the prisoners are the two men.

CHARLES STEVENS . I am a ship's fireman living at Causing Town

—on December 6th I came off my boat and had got my money—I had a few glasses of drink—on turning round a corner I was pulled up from behind—I cannot say who did it—somebody knocked me down senseless—the last witness picked me up—I do not remember any more—I had on me a half-sovereign, 5s. in silver, and 3d. bronze, and a silk handkerchief round my neck which cost me 5s. 6d.—I had a nasty poke in the eye and my head was struck against a wall.

GEORGE BAKER (Detective K.) About 2.30 p.m. on December 7th I was in East India Dock Road and saw the prisoners standing outside the Pay Office where sailors are paid off—I told them I was a police officer and should take them into custody for robbing a sailor on the previous afternoon at the bottom of Salmon Lane—I arrested Gownlock—he said, ""All right, I'll go quiet""—he was taken to the station and placed with twelve others and picked out by Cockcroft without any hesitation—he made no answer when charged—I could not then find the prosecutor, but charged the prisoners myself on the evidence of the first witness—Detective Benton arrested Hunter.

WILLIAM BENTON (Detective K.) I was with Baker and arrested Hunter on December 7th—he was taken to the station and charged—he made no reply—when Baker told him he would be taken into custody for robbing a man he said, ""Robbing a man?""and I said, ""Yes.""

Hunter: ""I was surprised.""

Gownlock's defence. ""All I say is I am innocent and I never see the witness there nor the prosecutor.""

Hunter, in his defence, said that he was arrested near where he lived; that he was standing at the top of the street and that he gave his mother's address when charged, for the reason that he had a wife and three children at home; that one was dying and he did not want his wife upset.

GUILTY . GOWNLOCK then PLEADED GUILTY to a conviction of felony at the Thames Police Court on May 20th, 1905, and HUNTER to a conviction of felony at the Thames Police Court on June 3rd, 1904, in the name of Charles Abbott. Three other convictions were proved against Gownlock and two against Hunter. The police stated that the prisoners were associates of a dangerous gang of thieves who wait for drunken sailors, make them drunk, and then rob them. Three years' penal servitude each."
Theft,"ROBERT LYON (Detective-Inspector, City). On the morning of November 10th I received notice of a burglary at Messrs. Prager's, of 1, Aldersgate Buildings—I caused every inquiry to be made at pawnbrokers and dealers and various places, and from information I obtained I went on November 21st to the London Fur Company at 1, Oxford Street, where I saw Mr. Barder, the manager, who produced some skins, amongst them being this sable (Produced), which I took possession of on account of the marks perforated in it—it has since been identified by Mr. Benjamin, one of the partners of Messrs. Prager, as their property—that same day I went with Mr. Benjamin, Detective-Sergeant Stewart and other officers, to No. 1, Upper Street, Islington—while there I saw the prisoner in the street—he was a stranger to me, but he was pointed out to me—I stopped him and told him we were police officers from the City making inquiries inspecting a case of warehouse breaking which had occurred in the City on the 10th—I said, ""Can you tell me anything about it?""—he said, ""I cannot ""—I did not at that time mention Frager's name—I said, ""We are inquiring about a case of warehouse breaking at 1, Aldersgate Buildings, and a number of furs and skins have been stolen; do you know anything about it?""—he said, ""No ""—I then showed him this little fur and said, ""Hive you sold any skins to Mr. Barder lately?""—he said, ""No ""—I then showed him the skin and told him I had received it from Mr. Barder, who had told me he had purchased it from him along with other skins, and I said, ""This gentleman here,"" that is Mr. Benjamin, ""has identified it from skins stolen from their place on the 10th,"" to which the prisoner

made no reply—he had said he had sold no skins to Barder recently—I then told him he must consider himself in custody, and said, ""Where do you live?""—he said, ""Anywhere ""—I said, ""Have you got a workshop?""—he said, ""No ""—I said, ""You have got both, an address and a workshop; I know both addresses ""—he made no reply, and I said, ""I am going to take you there. You are going to 98, Prebend Street, Islington ""—on the way there, in my presence, he handed over two parcels, which he was carrying—I opened them and one contained a Russian sable and the other a bau-marden, which is a fur—they have both been identified by Mr. Benjamin as part of the stolen property—when the prisoner handed Detective Marriott the parcel he said, ""That is some of what you are looking for; you will find others where you are going ""—he did not say where he got them from—the premises at 98, Prebend Street, are a workshop, and when we went there the prisoner opened the street door with a key and also the door opening into a room—we found a large quantity of furs in boxes, skins and a quantity of tails in a cupboard, all identified by Mr. Benjamin, with the exception of a few rabbit pieces—we also found a few furrier's tools—we have recovered about £450 of property; the reported loss was £750—all I recovered was in the prisoner's possession at his shop, with the exception of the skins taken to the London Fur Company; when we had collected the goods there was practically nothing else—I asked him to account for the possession of the property or produce receipts, and he said, ""They were brought to me by a man in a van, but I was not here at the time ""—he did not say how the man got in—immediately afterwards he said, ""They were brought hen by a man; I was here when he came ""—I told him he would be charged with breaking and entering 1, Aldersgate Buildings, and stealing and receiving a large quantity of furs—he said, ""You cannot charge me with stealing; I received them, and you have got them here ""—I took him to Moor Lane police station, where he was charged, and next morning, when he was taken from the cell to go to the Police Court, he said to me, ""I got the stuff from two foreigners; they were introduced to me in the street by a man whom I do not know. One of the foreigners is a short man; that is all I know about him. ""

Cross-examined. On this day I had the prisoner under observation for about fifteen minutes—he went into a public-house and I went into another bar; I only saw him have one drink; he was not there long—he spoke to another man who was a bit younger than himself and a bit taller, but I should not say he was a foreigner—I told the prisoner it was warehouse breaking which I was inquiring about, and asked him if he knew anything about it, and he said he knew nothing about it—he did not appear very much taken aback when I suggested that he might; be able to help me—he did not resent it in any way, but was very frank—he has been rather sullen all the way through and would not say-any thing one way or the other—I have made inquiries about him—he has been carrying on business at these premises for about twelve months—he has dealt with Mr. Barder for a great number of years, and I believe those transactions have turned out satisfactorily—on this day I do not

think he had been drinking to excess; he did not appear to be suffering from the after-effects of drink.

PHILIP BARDER . I am a partner in the London Fur Company at 1, Oxford Street—I have had a good many dealings with the prisoner and have bought from him from time to time—on November 11th I bought a parcel of fur from him containing twenty dyed sables; these (Produced) are some of them—he did not say where he got them from; he came in the ordinary way—I have known him for twenty years—I gave him the ordinary trade price for the furs and he gave me a receipt in the ordinary way (Produced)—on November 18th he came again and I bought Another parcel of twenty-two sables—that was in the ordinary way of business, and I have the receipt for them—they have been since identified by Mr. Benjamin—I paid the prisoner £20 for the first lot and £33 for the second, which I considered a very fair value—the price of sables varies very much; it depends on the quality—you can get them as low as 10s. each and you can go up to as much as £20 a skin—the prisoner left both panels of skins with me over night for me to decide if I would buy them, and he took my price, but I forget if there was any question about it.

Cross-examined. I paid the prisoner on both occasions by cheque made payable to himself—generally it was a very small account; I paid cash—I do not know that I have had larger quantities from him; this was rather a large amount for him—I believe he sells on commission, and I think he mentioned something about selling these skins for somebody else, and he told me he had to pay almost as much as I paid him and wanted very little profit—he did not say for whom he was selling them—the furs do not show the wholesale people to whom they belong—we never take notice of the perforated marks, but we always expect to see the marks on them, and we always buy dressed skins—the merchants stamp the leather, not perforate it—the perforations would not identify who the sellers were—every purchaser of raw skins puts his marks on them.

By the COURT. Different firms have their perforating mark, so if the person to whom they belong looked at the mark, he would know to whom they belong.

GEORGE BENJAMIN . I am a partner in the firm of Prager & Co., at 1, Abrogate Buildings—on Thursday, November 9th, I left the premises about 8.45 p.m.—it was then our busy time—I locked the place up; nobody sleeps there—we occupy the upper part of the building and we bad a separate door leading to that part—next morning my son arrived and found the place opened—I got there about 10.30—we had padlocks and staples on the doors—I found that we had been robbed, and after taking stock we found property to the value of £880 had been stolen besides a sable jacket valued at £230 which had been entrusted to us for alterations by Tudor Brothers, of Knightsbridge—I have since identified as mine a quantity of furs by the perforations in the skin, which we hit with a hammer when we buy them—different firms have different perforations—the total value of the skins recovered, unmanufactured, is £440—we were insured against burglary.

Cross-examined. The identification of the skins is quite easy to us—any one in the fur trade could tell whose they are, as they could identify our stamp, ""C. P. ""—there is no other ""C. P."" in the trade.

ALFRED BENJAMIN . I am the last witness's son and opened up the premises on Friday, November 10th, when I found they had been broken into.

JOHN STEWART (Detective-Sergeant, City). On November 22nd I went with Mr. Benjamin to the London Fur Company when a number of skins were produced and identified by him—he picked some of them out and I have them here (Produced).

The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he had been in the fur trade for forty-five years; that he received the furs from two Germans, who brought them to his place for him to alter some of them to make them fashionable, to make up others and to receive 10 per cent, commission if he found a customer; that he was to meet the foreigners in Upper Street to pay them the money he received for the skins he sold; that he did not know who they were or where they lived; that he paid them the money he received from Mr. Barder and got nothing out of it himself; that the cheques he received from Mr. Barder were open, and he changed them across the counter; that he did not know the furs were stolen; and that when he was arrested he was not sober, having had seven or eight drinks that day.

GEORGE BENJAMIN (Re-examined by the COURT). All the skins were marked in the same way—Mr. Barder would know where they came from when buying them.

PHILIP BARDER (Re-examined by the COURT). We did not look at the perforated marks on the skins, because every skin we buy dressed has a perforated mark—knowing the prisoner as I did, I thought he was selling the skins on commission for the person to whom they belonged, and whether they belonged to ""C. P."" or not, would not make any difference.

By the JURY. I did not know when I paid for them that a burglary had been committed at this warehouse—I did not hear of it until the police told me—the skins were not marked in such a way that you could see them; there was only one which was clearly marked and the owners hardly identified them themselves.

GUILTY . Nine months' hard labour."
Deception,"SIR FRANCIS ASTLEY CORBETT . I live at 45, Cadogan Gardens, and am a member of the Guards' club—I was at that club on Tuesday, October 10th, between 5 and 6 p.m., in the smoking room, which is also used as a card room—no one else was then in the room—I rang the bell, and sat down at a writing table, and started writing a letter—the bell was answered, but I am unable to say by which waiter—I know Leonard Caffrey is a waiter at the club, and attends the smoking room and card room—I asked the waiter for Cox's cheque book, and he brought it—while writing the letter I took out two cheques, one of which I made out for £10—I asked the waiter to get it cashed in the club—he brought me the change as I was still writing the letter—I put the other cheque on the table—I finished my letter, and then filled up the cheque that was on the table for £30 in favour of Mr. J. H. Saunders, drawn to order—I put it inside a letter, and the letter in an envelope, addressed it, took it downstairs, and put it in a letter box, which is on a round table close to the door—I always make it a rule to initial the counterfoil, put in the date and the amount, and pay the waiter the 1d. for the stamp—I did so in this case, as far as I remember—downstairs I met three other members, and returned with them to the smoke room—I had been out of the room about ten or fifteen minutes—nobody was in the room when I got back—I ordered cards from the waiter, and played two rubbers of bridge—I left town the next day—I returned to London on Monday, the 16th—I looked for, but could find no acknowledgment of my cheque—I left London again on the 17th, and returned on Friday, the 20th—I arrived about 10 p.m., and left the next day about 2, I think—I made inquiries, and in consequence saw Mr. Evans about it—an attempt was made to find the counterfoils of my cheques—I could find the counterfoil of a cheque that I wrote afterwards, but not any counterfoil of those two cheques—after that I communicated with Mr. Evans as to the missing letter and the missing cheque—this is we cheque I drew.

Cross-examined. The second cheque form was on the table when the waiter brought in the change—I did not summon him again—I played two rubbers and stayed till about 7 p.m.—the club is comparatively empty at that time of the year, as a good many officers are away.

Re-examined. The waiter took the cheque book away after I had taken

the cheques out—when I was writing my letter the second cheque form was lying next to me.

JOSEPH HARRY SAUNDERS . I am the secretary of the Princes club at Knightsbridge—in October last Sir Francis Corbett had occasion to remit me £30—I did not receive this cheque for £30 in my favour, or any letter enclosing it—the signature on it is not mine—it is a forgery—if anybody cashed that cheque it was not cashed with my authority.

CHARLES HAVEY MALIM . I live at 46, Boundaries Road, Balham, and am chief cashier at Cox's Bank—Sir Francis Corbett banks there, as well as the majority of the members of the Guards' Club—I cashed the cheque produced on October 11th—I find from my notes that I gave in exchange for it £20 in gold, two £5 notes, Nos. 61199 and 61200, dated April 19th, 1905—the cheque was in order and I took for granted that the signature was genuine—it is an order cheque—I knew the signature of the customer, but I did not know the signature of the endorser—as far as I can judge from the entries in my book, the time I cashed the cheque was from 11.30 to 12 o'clock—I do not recognise the person I paid—our bank supply cheque books to the Guards' Club for the use of the members generally—the book produced includes Nos. 582801 to 582850, which includes the cheque produced, 582847—a manservant generally comes for a new cheque book, which is entered as supplied to the club—we change several cheques for members during the day—a cheque book is delivered to the messenger without any written order, on payment of the amount for the stamps, so we do not have to charge for the cheque books in the account with the club, but we keep a record—this cheque book is dated September 30th.

Cross-examined. I cannot tell you the exact time the cheque was cashed; I only judge from the entries in my book—it is purely a guess—I cannot tell you what time the porter came that morning to cash cheques, but one or other of the porters usually come about 10.30—they must come to my desk—I know two or three of the club servants—I do not know Leonard Caffrey—I recognised at the time that the cheque was one of Sir Francis Corbett's, who I knew was a member of the Guards' Club—a cheque for £10 was cashed in the ordinary course, but I do not recollect who presented it—when I find a cheque is in order it is paid as a matter of course—other clubs are constantly sending servants to change cheques; the number depends upon the time of year—one cheque book is dated July 29th, another August 4th; on August 12th there were two, on September 7th there was one, and on September 19th there was one, so that the average would be about two a fortnight—on September 30th two books were issued.

Re-examined. I should not like to say that I feel certain, but in my own mind I think the £30 cheque was cashed before lunch.

JOSEPH PERCIVAL HUDSON . I am a clerk in the Bank Note Office of the Bank of England—I produce two £5 notes, Nos. 61199 and 61200, dated April 19th, 1905—with the exception of the cancellation or destruction of the note they are in the same condition as when they were returned

WILLIAM HOLBECK . I am a lieutenant in the Guards, and a member

of the Guards' Club—I was in that club on October 12th—I remember drawing a cheque on one of the club cheque forms for £10—I was in the card room, which is also called the smoking room—the waiter handed me the cheque book, and I handed him the cheque to cash—I do not remember which waiter it was, but whoever he was, he brought me back the change—I know I had a £5 note, but there might have been some silver—I did not take a note of the number—looking at this bank note, No. 61200, I should say this is the note—I paid it to a friend, A. Rushton—I do not think I had another £5 note in my possession that day; if I had I should not have changed the cheque.

Cross-examined. I am positive I did not get any other money that day subsequent to this £10—I cannot say whether I had a note, or what money I had in my pocket at the time—I cannot say what other notes the person I gave that note to might have had in his possession—I cannot say whether the note I parted with on the 12th is the same that was paid to Peter Robinson & Co.

ILENE DAVEY . I am employed at Peter Robinson's, in Oxford Street—this bank note, No. 61200, and marked on the back ""A. Rushton,"" was paid to me for our firm on October 13th in payment of the bill produced, which shows the name of the customer as ""Rushton ""—I handed it to the cashier in the usual way.

MAUD GEAR . I am a clerk in the Post Office at Harringay—on October 14th I received this bank note, No. 61199, in payment of a money order for £2 19s. in the name of A. G. Caffrey—this is the duplicate which I keep—the original is handed to the person who pays the money. [This was a Post Office Order, payable from A. G. Caffrey to G. Nelson & Sons, builders, Dalston Lane, for £2 19s., and dated October 14th.]

Cross-examined. Our post office is about five minutes' walk from 18, Grand Parade—I know the laundry business there—the person who came gave me the name and address at the same time that I was handed the £5 note—our post office is the nearest to that place—I do not know Alttrnon Caffrey as a customer.

FREDERICK CHARLES EVANS . I am secretary to the Guards' Club, Pall Mall—Leonard Douglas Caffrey was a waiter in that club from March 26th, 1001—his attendance was required on what we call two long days, and the then on a short day, including Sundays—on the long days he would have to he in attendance from 8 a.m. till 1 a.m. the next morning—October 11th was his short day, when he would attend from 1 p.m. till 3.30 p.m., or inereabouts; then he would go off duty, come on again at 7 p.m. and remain till 9.15 or 9.30 p.m. to cover the dinner-hour—that would refer to October 10th and 11th; the 12th would be his long day again, when he would be in attendance for exactly the same hours as on the 10th—to duties would be to attend on the members in the card room, or the smoking room on October 10th and 12th—he would not share those duties with anybody; he would be the only card room waiter at that time—the card room head waiter, and the coffee room head waiter were supplied each with a cheque book from Cox's bank—we sent for these cheque books as they were required, and there would be at least two in use, and if one

book was running near the end another book would be sent for, for the convenience of the members—the box produced is for the members letters, and is kept locked till the page boy, who has a key, collects the letters, puts them in a bag, and takes them to the post—after Sir Francis Corbett's letter was missed I tried to get out of the box an empty envelope and got it out within ten seconds by turning the box over—after that I asked for the counterfoils of the cheque books, when I was told they were never kept—up to that time the counterfoils remained with the waiters, and they did what they liked with them, but afterwards I looked through what counterfoils I could find—I also found this nearly finished book for the card room, which was issued on September 30th, 1905—I could not find any counterfoil of the cheque of Sir Francis Corbett, and I was told that the counterfoils of that particular cheque book had been destroyed—I searched through the counterfoils of other books, but could not find ""Sir Fancis' counterfoil—the next day I spoke to Leonard Caffrey—as far as I remember, I asked him, ""What did you do with the counterfoils!""—he said they had never been kept—I expressed my surprise that the counterfoils had not been kept, and gave instructions that they were to be kept in the future—as far as my memory goes, I told him what had happened on the previous day as to Sir Francis bringing this cheque to my notice, when I asked for the counterfoils of the cheque book, Nos. 582801 to 582850—the few cheques left in the book would be used up on that or the following day, probably the same day—the last date is ""17-10-05 ""—there must have been that cheque in the smoking room at the time, and also the other one which was issued on September 30th from the bank—Leonard Caffrey would attend to the smoking room, and would not attend to the coffee room—the post boy collected the letters about 5.40—he would start collecting about five minutes before that time—he does not warn the members of his going to collect—this is the other cheque No. 582848, drawn by Sir Francis Corbett for £10.

Cross-examined. Besides that cheque, No. 582848, two other cheque forms would remain out on October 10th, assuming Sir Francis is correct as to dates—inquiries were commenced on October 20th—the other cheque forms in the book would probably be used up on the 10th—when another cheque book was applied for, half a dozen cheques might remain in the book in use—Leonard Caffrey attended to the smoking room and library too—he would be entitled to have a cheque book—we have two waiters in the coffee room, Stott and Noakes, who each have a cheque book on Cox's bank, but although one is issued to each of the smoking room waiters, the waiters coming on alternate days, the one off duty would lock his cheque book up, so that practically there was only one in use—the head waiter on his short day comes on duty at luncheon time there are two head waiters; the one who is on duty has charge of the cheque book—on his ""off"" day the head waiter will come on duty at from about 1 p.m. till about 2.30, or thereabouts—I am not clear whether he comes on again in the dinner hour—not many members turn up in the dinner hour—as a rule, they mostly come in to luncheon—I found that the cheque book of the smoking room waiter was kept in an unlocked

drawer, and that any servant of the club could obtain access to it in order to supply a member with a cheque—Leonard Caffrey would be supplied with a cheque book, provided he brought the 4s. 2d. for the stamps—Jarman may have acted as a smoking room waiter, in which case he would be supplied with a cheque book from our office—I have never kept a record of the cheque books supplied, but the bank does—Leonard Caffrey would have his meal hours, but he would have to answer his own belt—if he was absent most likely other waiters would wait till he was disengaged—Caffrey would very rarely have to answer the morning room bell—I discovered that more than one cheque book was in use in the smoking sad ia the morning room at that particular time, and that the cheques were kept in the morning room, in a drawer which was open to anyone who went there—when Sir Francis made a complaint to me on October 20th about the cheque, Leonard Caffrey was off duty—I at once made inquiries—I asked Herman and Jarman for the counterfoils—they told me they had not been kept, and that it had not been the practice to keep them in the smoking room—Herman was on duty that morning, but both waiters were present in the morning room, when I gave instructions that the counterfoils should be kept—I have been secretary since May, 1905—I know it is the practice of members who use the smoking room to frequently leave the counterfoils of their cheques blank—looking at these counterfoils produced, only about a third are filled in, so that about two-thirds are quite useless—it is no part of the duty of the waiter to fill in the counterfoil, and I do not see how he would know what to fill in—is the coffee room he would know, but in the smoking room it is quite different—in the dining room if the member wants a little more money the charge for his luncheon is taken out. of it, or for his dinner, and in that case the member fills in the counterfoil himself—the day following, when I was told by Herman and Jarman that it was not the practice to keep these counterfoils, I saw Leonard Caffrey—the first information I got about destroying the counterfoils was from the two waiters, and I issued orders to keep them on the 20th, and on the 21st as well—Leonard Caffrey has been employed by the club about five years—during that time he has borne an excellent character—he had been in the habit of handling cheques most of the time at any rate—he may have been a page boy when he entered the service at eighteen years of age, and he is now twenty-three.

Re-examined. During the few months I have been there, finding things slovenly I endeavoured to correct them, and among other things I directed that the counterfoils should be kept—rules are made for the members, but I have no control over them.

JOHN HENRY STOTT . I am one of the head waiters employed at the Guards' Club—there are two head waiters, who are on duty on alternate dates from 8 a.m. till 1 a.m. the next day and on what is called ""the short day,"" when we come for luncheon and dinner, or from 1 till 2.30, and from 7 till 9—I had a Cox's cheque book in my possession—I kept it in the desk in the dining room—when a member wanted a cheque in the coffee room I supplied him with one, for which he sometimes gave me a penny—

on my long days anybody wanting a cheque would come to me—on the short days I locked my cheque book up—when Noakes was on duty he would use his own cheque book—I should only use my own; I should not have his—if applied to for a cheque on my short day, when I should not be on duty, I should bring Noakes' cheque book—I kept the counterfoils of my cheque books—I have them for about three years—very often the counterfoils were rot filled up; they were sometimes missed—my counterfoils are all initialled—these are mine—one book covers from August 2nd till October 11th, another one from October 13th till November 6th.

Cross-examined. I have never got my own cheque book when Noakes was on duty—provided he was called away he would leave it in the dining room, where mine would be if I was on duty—my book would be in my stock cupboard when I left at night—the other book would be lying on the desk in the coffee room—most cheques I give to members are handed back to me to cash—I have filled in heaps of counterfoils—members leave them in blank—I keep the record for myself—I always keep them, and they were kept even before I came to this club—I do not know that there were any particular orders to that effect—sometimes a waiter would come to me from another part of the club for a cheque—I should take the whole cheque book to the member who would expect to use the book—I would not mind my cheque book going out of my possession; there is no secret about it—there is no desire to keep the cheque books, locked up.

FRANK NOAKES . I am a head waiter at the Guards' Club on alternate duty with Stott—I was on duty on October 10th and 12th—these are my counterfoils of cheques from August 3rd to October 12th and from October 12th to November 1st—I keep my counterfoils for about three years—on October 12th I cashed a cheque for Lieutenant Holbeck for £10—I gave him the change and kept no record.

Cross-examined. I may have given Lieutenant Holbeck five sovereigns or two notes.

THOMAS WILLIAM SWINDELL . I am one of the page boys employed at the Guards' Club—part of my duty is to collect the letters from the boxes, including the box for the smoking room—I have a key given mo for that purpose—I do not tilt the boxes up to get the letters out—I collect for the various posts during the day from 9.25 a.m. till between 5 and 6 p.m.—my hours are from 8 a.m. till 8 p.m. one day, and from 8 a.m. till 9 p.m. the next day—I collect at 5.40 to 5.46 for the 6 o'clock post—I put the letters in a bag, put the bag on my shoulders and take it to the post in St. James' Street.

THOMAS TAPPENDKN (Detective A.) I was given this matter to in into, and in consequence of my inquiries I went to see Algernon Caffery on November 3rd, about 4 p.m., at 18, Grand Parade, Harringay, where he occupies premises which are used as a small laundry—I told him I was a police officer, and was making inquiries about a £5 note that he had cashed at the post office opposite—he hesitated for a minute or two, and then said, ""I remember cashing a £5 note for a money order for £2 19s. ""—I said, ""Where did you get that note from?"" and I asked him

when—he said he got it about a fortnight ago, and, ""I went to Finsbury Park Post Office to get two or three notes for gold, but I could only get two ""—he said he wanted them to pay his rent to his landlord, and, ""While I was in the Finsbury Post Office I was accosted by a man who offered to let me have one, but I did not have anything to do with him. I came out and got into the electric tram, when the man followed me, and said, 'Won't you have this note? It is perfectly all right.' I asked him his name, and he said his name was Scott, and as he appeared to be a respectable man I took the note and gave him the gold ""—I said, ""Do you know where that man lives?""—he said, ""He gave me a card with Wareham Road on it; I do not remember the number ""—Wareham Road is near at hand—I said, ""Have you got that card now?""—he said, ""Yes, I think I have got it in my clothes,"" and he went away to fetch it through a private side door—he returned shortly afterwards and said, ""I cannot find it; I must have destroyed it ""—I said, ""You had better endeavour to find the card, as this note is Dart of the proceeds of a forged cheque ""—I then went away—the following day I went to the Guards' club, and had a communication with Mr. Evans—in consequence of what! to laid I went back with him to 18, Grand Parade, where I saw Algernon Caffrey again—I said to him, ""Have you communicated with your brother?""—he said, ""Yes, I wrote to him last night ""—I had not suggested to him anything else about the ""brother, and did not know anything about him at that time—I did not mention the Guards' Club—to—thing I had found out since I had seen him the day before made me ask him, ""Have you communicated with your brother?""—I said, ""Is your brother in?""—I meant was he in the building, assuming that he was living with his brother—he said, ""Yes, I think so ""—he went to the tide door and opened it, and met his brother in the passage—it was a private door—I said to Mr. Evans, ""Is this the waiter employed at the club?""—he had left the club and was off duty—Mr. Evans said, ""Yes ""—I then told Leonard Caffrey that a cheque had been stolen and forged at the Guards' Club, belonging to Sir Francis Astley Corbett, and that his brother had been found dealing with one of the notes, part of the proceeds of that cheque—he said, ""I do not know anything about it; it seems to me that my brother has been made a dupe of by someone who has got a grudge against me ""—Mr. Evans, myself, and the two prisoners then went back to the club—I asked Leonard to show me the letter his brother had written—he fetched it from one of his livery coats in his bedroom—we were in the secretary's office when he went away and fetched it—he handed it to me—I then took the prisoners to Cannon Row (Letter read): ""From Ranks & Co., Laundrymen, Dyers, and Cleaners, Chief Office, 18, Grand Parade, Harringay. Dear Len,—You will be surprised to hear that I have had a visit from a detective to-night. You remember I told you some time ago that I went to Finsbury Park Post Office to get some £5 notes for gold. A man there in the shop offered to let me have some, which I told you I refused on the advice of the girl behind the desk, but I never told you that I afterwards accepted one on meeting him in the car on the way home, because I thought you might think me

a fool for doing so, but I did, and you see what a mess I have caused by so doing. The detective told me the note was stolen, and, therefore, I am under suspicion for changing it. Do not tell anyone, as he told me to keep it secret. The fellow gave me a card with Scott, Wareham Road, on it, but nobody lives there of that name, so it must have been false. Trusting it will end satisfactorily, I remain, Your Affe. Bro., Alg. I am keeping my eyes open for the blackguard, so am quite an amateur detective. N.B. Splendid trade this week ""—when charged at Cannon Row, Leonard said, ""Absolutely not guilty ""—Algernon made no reply.

Cross-examined. I have made inquiries, and find that both prisoners bear excellent characters—I know that they are jointly interested in the laundry business carried on at 18, Grand Parade, Harringay—it is a very decent business—they live there with their grandmother, and they have let off a greater portion of the premises—I know there is a surgery there, but I did not know there were flats let off, but the lettings considerably reduce their rent—the Harringay Post Office is within twenty yards of their place—I knew that Algernon had exchanged a note for a money order; I had been shown the counterfoil—when I told Algernon I was a police officer I suppose he hesitated to collect himself, or probably my telling him that might frighten him—he spoke quite frankly—he said that the girl behind the counter at the Finsbury Post Office told him that she was glad that he had not taken the note of the man—on the way back to the club I went to the post office, and spoke to the girl—the confirmed what Algernon had said to a certain extent—she is not witness—I did not tell him he had better not try to find the card, but try to find the man—Leonard at that time had gone off duty—Algernon told me he had written to him the night before—Leonard produced the letter after we got back to the club, and handed it to me—both prisoners were frank—there was no secrecy about anything.

C. H. MALIM (Re-examined). Sir Francis Corbett's cheque for £10 was cashed in the usual way the next morning by the ordinary servant of the bank—it was presented on the morning of the 11th by a messenger from the Guards' Club.

Cross-examined. I cannot remember the individual who came—the approximate time was about 10.30.

T. TAPPENDEN (Re-examined by the COURT). I went with Algernon and Leonard to the Finsbury Park Post Office on November 4th—I saw a Miss Coates, who was in charge—Algernon said, ""Do you remember my getting some £5 notes?""—Miss Coates said, ""Yes, I remember something about it,"" and to the best of my recollection she said, ""But I am not certain about your face ""—he then said to her, ""Do you remember a man offering to let me have a note?""—she said, ""Yes, I do remember such a coincidence, and I was glad you did not have anything to do with it ""—she is here. [MR. FRAMPTON stated that Miss Coates had been subpœnaed for the Defence, but having got that statement from Sergeant Tappenden, he did not propose to call her. The COURT held that she was a proper witness for the Prosecution.]

ALICE JESSIE COATES . I am a clerk at the Finsbury Park Post Office—

it is about fifteen minutes' walk from the Grand Parade, Harringay, across the park—I remember someone coming there and getting notes for gold in October, but I do not remember the day, nor if it was the prisoner Algernon—he asked for one more than I could supply, but I do not remember the number he required—I remember that a man stepped forward and offered him one—his words were to the effect, ""Here is one ""—the offer was refused, and after the man had gone I said to the man who required the note, ""It is quite as well you did not take it; you do not know where they get them from ""—I remember, perhaps a fortnight afterwards, the officer coming with other men, when I gave the account I have now given.

Cross-examined. The man who offered the note I scarcely looked at—he appeared to be respectable—the office is a busy one—the men did not leave together—about ten women are employed there.

Leonard Douglas Caffrey, in his defence on oath, denied ever having obstructed a letter; or that he knew anything about the cheque for £30 being stolen or cashed; or that he changed a note in the dub when giving change to Lieutenant Holbeck or anyone; or that he handed to his brother, or caused to be handed to him, a £5 note to cash, the proceeds of the stolen cheque; k stated that he was interested with his brother in the laundry business, which cost £180, £80 of which had been lent by his late employer, the rest being his savings; that there were other waiters attending the smoking room and coffee room at the club, and that the members did not always fill in the couterfoils; that it was not the practice to keep them; and that he could not account for the coincidence of the note being traced to his brother. On the suggestion of the Jury he volunteered to write twice on a sheet of paper the words ""J. H. Saunders"" This was compared with his writing in a letter which he had written to Tappenden about bail, and with the writing on the back of the cheque.

Algernon Gilbert Caffrey, in his defence on oath, said that he had taken a £5 note from the man he had previously seen in the Finsbury Park Post Office for the purpose of forwarding to his landlord with other notes he had obtained at the Poet Office to pay his rent; that the man was about forty-fine years of age, and looked respectable, but he had subsequently ascertained that he could get a money order for the whole amount; that he never received any such note from hut brother, and only wrote to him the letter produced and read after the visit from Tappenden. He also voluntarily wrote twice ""J. H. Saunders. ""

The following evidence was called by the direction of the COURT:—

HENRY JARMAN . I am smoking room waiter at the Guards' Club—I was at the club on October 10th from 1 o'clock till 2.45, but was off duty for the rest of the day till I arrived at the club the next morning—I did not the next morning change a cheque at Cox's Bank for £30—I have no knowledge of that transaction—I do not sleep on the club premises—I live at Gee's Court, Oxford Street, with my wife—the first I heard of the matter of this cheque was when inquiries were made in the secretary's room.

ARTHUR GEORGE HERMAN . I am morning room waiter at the Guards' Club—I have been there sixteen months—I sleep on the premises—on

October 10th I was on duty from 8 a.m. till 1 a.m. on the 11th—it is no part of my duty to help in the smoking room—I know nothing about the £30 cheque that was stolen on October 10th—I had nothing to do with it—I do not know anything about its being cashed the next day at the bank, nor anything about the letter addressed to Mr. Saunders—I do not answer the bell in the smoking room in place of the other waiter—supposing the bell kept ringing, very likely my own bell would be rung.

Cross-examined. The waiters are all friendly—we have assisted one another, but very seldom; we have enough to do in our own rooms.

F. C. EVANS (Re-examined). We send our own waiter every day to the bank—I have never sent Leonard Caffrey—the person who generally goes is named Aubrey—he is our official representative. [MR. FRAMPTON produced the receipt for the rent of 18, Grand Parade, dated October 13th, made out in the name of Leonard Caffrey, for £33 13s., including insurance.]

The Jury, being unable to agree, were discharged and the trial postponed until next Sessions ,"
Theft,"CHARLES CHAPMAN (Detective, City). On December 15th about 12.15, I went to the prisoner's shop at 67, Huggin Lane, City—I said to him, ""Are you the proprietor?""—he said, ""No; what is it you want?""—he is a waste paper dealer—I said, ""I am a police officer; I want to see the proprietor ""—he said, ""He is out ""—he saw me looking at a piece of anti-friction metal there, and said, ""What is it you want to know: who brought that lead here?""—I said, ""I may do later on ""—he said, ""A bloke brought it just round the corner; I will soon fetch him ""—he left the shop—from what I was told I waited in the shop about four hours—the prisoner did not return—I and other officers took possession of a quantity of lead—about 60 lbs. weight has been identified, and this piece of anti-friction metal—about 8 o'clock the same evening I, with Inspector Lyon and Detective Annerton, saw the prisoner in the Bell public-house, Bush Lane—Annerton had stayed in the shop till 6 p.m., I stayed till 5—I called him outside the public-house, when Lyon said to him, ""We are going to take you into custody; you will be charged with receiving a quantity of lead, well knowing it to have been stolen ""—he said, ""Wait a few minutes ""—he was then taken to Cloak Lane police station, where he was shown thin piece of metal—Lyon said, ""This piece of metal has been stolen from 49, Queen Victoria Street, and has been found in your possession; how do you account for its having been in your possession?""—he said, ""I know nothing about it ""—he was then shown a quantity of other lead, amongst which were these pieces produced—he produced this receipt, dated December 13th, from R. Gillver—the date below is ""15-12-05 ""—on the window of his shop in Huggin Lane is the name of ""Francis & Co., Wholesale Waste Paper and Metal Merchants,"" and

that is on the business card used by him—the shop is about 150 yards from where the lead was stolen—I also found a quantity of paper in the shop which has been identified as stolen.

Cross-examined. About 30 lbs. of lead piping has not been identified—the address on this receipt is 6, Dowgate Hill, which is close to the public-house where the prisoner was arrested, and the next turning to it—I was looking at the anti-friction magnolia metal when the prisoner said, ""What do you want to know?""—there was a small lot of lead there, but not this produced—I did not take any note of the conversation—there was another man in the shop at the time; there may have been two—I am positive when I told the prisoner I was a police officer that he said he was not the proprietor—the conversation did not take a minute; he was gone as soon as he had the chance—at the public-house he did not say the man from whom he got the receipt sold him the lead—when I asked him about the anti-friction metal he said he knew nothing about it.

Re-examined The prisoner did not offer to produce any receipt when I called at the shop.

WALTER MILLER . I am a foreman of Messrs. Noix, who trade as photo printers, of Queen Victoria Street—on November 27th I identified at the police station the lead piping produced as the property of my employers—I had seen it affixed to the wall of 49, Queen Victoria Street, which was a part of the premises that was under repair at the time—I know it by the joints, and by the sediments lodged in the piping, from the acid, which causes a black deposit in the joint, which I tied up with string when the piping was mended by me, and where I put a mark in at the stock end—no one had a right to remove ti from the wall where it had been placed—it does not show signs of how it has been removed, it has simply been torn down.

WILFRED DADD . I am the secretary of the Magnolia Anti-friction Metal Company of Great Britain, at 49, Queen Victoria Street—this lump of anti-friction metal is of the value of 50s.—I identify it as our property by the trade mark on the back—this is half an ingot—our premises were broken into when this metal was lying about, which it ought not to have been, but to have been under lock and key—it would have been but for a fire, when the firemen broke the cellar open—I know that we are 3 1/2 lbs. short, and this piece weighs 3 lbs.—if sold, there would have been a record in our books—I am certain this was not sold.

ALBERT HENRY STONE I am a porter, and live at 160, Corbeck Road, Camherwell, and am employed by Mr. Charles Newberry, of Angel Court, City—on December 15th, 1905, I stole some paper, and took it to 67, Hoggin Lane, where I saw Sergeant Chapman—I had left some on a previous occasion, it may have been about two or three weeks previous—I had stolen that too—when I took that parcel it was weighed by a man in the shop, and I was paid 4d. by the prisoner—he asked no question.

Cross-examined. I am quite sure I saw the prisoner—it was about three weeks before this charge—when I went on the last occasion I was taken into custody—the detective sent for a constable, and I was taken to the station—Chapman asked me questions—I was taken before the

Magistrate the next day, and the Magistrate bound me over to come up for judgment if called upon—one of the detectives told me I had better make a clean breast of it and it would be better for me—that would be on the 16th—they took me from Shepherdess Walk the next day—my address was taken—I quite understood I could be brought up for judgment at any time—after I had been bound over before the Magistrate I saw the police on one occasion before I was taken before' the Alderman—I cannot swear that this is the ream of paper I stole—it was similar—I had sold other paper to men in the shop, when the prisoner was not present—the prisoner only paid me on one occasion—I had been there before with paper.

Re-examined. On the other occasions I visited the shop the paper was stolen—when the sergeant spoke to me, the statement I made to him was true—I should not be likely to admit before the Magistrate that I had stolen paper if I had not done so.

ROBERT LYON (Detective, City) I went with other officers to the prisoner's address, and charged him with receiving this piece of antifriction metal—he made no reply then—when he was charged he said he knew nothing about it.

The prisoner, in his defence on oath, said that he had bought the business of Francis A Co. for £50 and had carried it on, and that the piping in question had been left at his place eight or nine days before the police arrived, by a man who had led him to understand that he was doing some repairs in the neighbourhood; that he weighed it, and found it was under 60 lbs., and was not sufficient for him to purchase, and that it was left there; that its value was about 8s. and not 50s., as stated by the prosecutor; that as to the ingot, he had not seen it in the shop till Lyons showed it to him; that he knew nothing about it, nor about the paper that was found in the shop, and he did not know it was there; that the lead he had bought of Mr. R. C. Gillver, of 6, Dowgate Hill, a plumber and gas engineer; that he went ""round the corner"" to fetch the man he had bought the metal from, and had found him at the public-house, but could not persuade him to come to the shop; and that he stopped with him till the police came, but he knew nothing about any of the property in his shop having been stolen.

GUILTY He received a good character. Eighteen month's hard labour."
Deception,"FRANCIS JOSEPH DUGGAN . I have been to South Africa and returned last February—I had then a little money—I was without employment—on April 7th, 1905, I saw this advertisement in the ""Daily Telegraph "": ""A City firm of auctioneers and land agents require a smart gentlemanly man to take charge of their offices. Security cash required. Address 'Reliable,' Horncastle's, Cheapside,"" and replied to it—I received this letter: ""With reference to your application, kindly give us a call tomorrow (Saturday) at 11 a.m. and oblige, Tours faithfully, Howarth Bros, & Co. ""—the letter has this printed heading: ""Howarth Bros. & Co., Auctioneers and Surveyors, Land Agents and Valuers. Expert Mortgage Brokers. Managers to the Hayling Estate, Ltd. And at 317, Lake Road, Portsmouth, and Branches. 21, Bucklersbury, Bank, E.C. ""—I called on April 8th at 21, Bucklersbury—I saw the name of ""Howarth Bros, & Co."" up—there were two clerks in the office—I noticed auction bills stuck up round the office—I saw the prisoner—he asked me if I wished to accept this employment as clerk in his office at a salary of £2 a week and would I deposit £100 cash security for fidelity, as I should be handling sums of money—I asked him if he was doing a good sound business—he said he was; that he had branches at Portsmouth, Bristol, Leeds and Bradford—I asked him how long he had been established in business as an auctioneer—he said between eight and nine years ""—I asked him what his financial position was—he said the debts of the establishment did not exceed £20—he said he would hold the security for me and repay it to me within one month of my leaving his service—

he farther said, ""You must not think we axe short of £100 ""—that was about all that took place at that time except that he said he had valuable options on which he would make a profit of £2,000 to £3,000—I did not know much about options—I agreed to pay him the £1CO—I offered him a cheque and he said he wanted it in cash—I had already made the cheque out and I asked him to indorse it—he did so and I took it to the bank and cashed it—I handed him the money in notes and gold [MR. OLIVER state that the defence acknowledged they had had the money]—I entered on my duties—I had practically nothing to do—I sat in the office reading the paper—I handled no money in a business way in the office—I went ones or twice to the bank with £8 or £9—many people came into the offiot, but I saw no business being done—I received my £2 a week—the prisoner said, ""We shall be very busy alter Easter; it is rather slack just now,"" and that he was going to register this company and that company and the other company after Easter, and that he wanted toother clerk in the office—he said he was doing a lot of oompany work—he said he had a company called the Cavity Ventilating Building-Block Co., and he wanted £200 to register this; that he was temporarily short, as he had paid £500 in respect of a contract for an estate called Eaststoke and had paid £175 for a contract for an estate called Menjin, Hayling Island, that he had paid £700 for a house at Harletden, but that he would be receiving £1,000 on June 1st out of his Hayling contracts; that he would make from £'2, 000 to £3,000 profit in all and would have the balance on September 1st—I thought what he told me was correct and I trusted him with £200—he asked for £260, but I had not got it—he wanted it in cash, but I drew a cheque—this is it, indorsed ""Howarth Bros. ""—I parted first with the £100 on his representations and with the £200 on his representation that he would get £1.000 on June 1st—I believed him to be a man of means and a man of high standing—I did not know that on the one occasion he had 14s. 6d. in the bank and on the other 19s. 9d.—I went on in the office—I found he was doing practically no business, that he was drawing cheques with nothing in the bank to meet them that the office rent had not been paid, so I said to him that he was not acting straight, that I believed his contracts he had were encumbered with debt and he had secured everybody else and left me in the lurch—he said, ""You have been misinformed. I have £1.785 to come: your information is another wrong ""—this was on August 28th—I do not at that time he had a contract in his possession at all—I lent him the £200 for a month on May 1st—I asked him for it back at the end of the month—he said, ""This company has not gone to allotment yet;, the purchase is going to be completed on Monday ""—when the Monday came it was to be on Friday and so on—this went on for months—when I did not get my money he offered me rooms in his house, which I accepted—out of my salary he stopped the rent—I had food with him for a fortnight and paid him separately for that—I went on hoping against hope and believing him when he said it would be settled this day and that day—it never has been settled—I left him on September 11th—I consulted a solicitor and laid an information against him.

Cross-examined. He did not tell me he was hard up, simply that he was temporarily short of money—he afterwards told me he was engaged in company work—he showed me prospectuses—I have seen this prospectus before (Produced)—I believe the names on it were direction, but the company has gone altogether—they are good people—that is what ""had"" me—I have heard of the Home Counties Building and Estates Company, Ltd.—I saw that prospectus—I do not know whether the directors of that were men of substance or not—he suggested I should advance the £200 for the purpose of registering one of the companies—there was no arrangement that I was to have anything if the company went through—he may have said after he had had the money that should have a bonus of £50, but there was no arrangement as to that—there was nothing said about interest—the money was handed to him as an act of friendship—if I had lent my money on business terms, I should have had an agreement drawn up by a solicitor—I do not remember his telling me that he expected to make £5,000 out of the Home Company—he was very enthusiastic about the companies—I thought it would turn out a good thing for him; I do not know about myself—that was not my idea in parting with the £200—I did not know that I was going to stay with him very long—I am not a money-lender—he may have said something about if the company turned out well he would recommend me as secretary—he said so many things that I cannot remember—in July I lent him a further £5, but he repaid that.

Re-examined. I know nothing about company promoting—I have a hazy idea about options—I have been in the Army—I do not understand these commercial transactions.

ALFRED JOHN CHAPMAN . I am a clerk at the Union of London & Smith's Bank, Chancery Lane—the prisoner had an account there—I produce a certified copy of that account taken from the boob—the account was opened on March 17th, 1905, with £50—on the 20th £30 was drawn out—on the 21st a cheque for £100 was paid in—up to April 10th, £175 had been paid in and £174 5s. 6d. drawn out, leaving a balance of 14s. 6d.—on April 10th £90 was paid in in cash—that was drawn out in the course of fourteen days—on the morning of May 1st the credit was £l 0s. 10d. on the evening of that day it had been increased by £170—that was drawn out in the course of about three weeks—the account stood the name of ""Howarth Bros, & Co.,"" but there was only one in the firm—the account is now closed, the balance having been dawn out by the Official Receiver—eighteen cheques have been returned be tween April 10th and the time the account was closed; they would I amount to about £250.

Cross-examined. There was a sequestration order made and the cheques have been returned since then—they were returned marked ""balance attached ""; that was up to August—after that date some were marked ""Not sufficient and Balance attached,"" and one was marked ""Refer to Drawer ""—I did not know that the firm had another banking account at Portsmouth.

Re-examined. There was a balance of £2, which remained at £2 until the order was removed; in the meantime many cheques had gone back marked as I say.

WILLIAM GEORGE BUTLESTONE . I am a messenger at the Bankruptcy Court and produce the file of the bankruptcy proceedings of Frank Harrison Howarth, trading as Howarth Bros, & Co.—the petition. was filed on August 30th, 1905, at the instance of Gale & Polden, Ltd., Amen tamer, Paternoster Row, printers, for debts of £172 ls. 4d.—a receiving order was made on November 10th—he was adjudicated bankrupt on December 15th—there is no statement filed yet—there was not time to do so, as the prisoner was arrested.

HENRY PHILLIPS (Detective Inspector, City). On December 4th last the prisoner was arrested on a warrant and brought to the Old Jewry police office—I read the warrant to him—it charged him with obtaining £300 in all by false pretences—in reply he said, ""It is absurd. I made a statement st. the Bankruptcy Court this morning that my estate was in excess of the liabilities, and that I hoped to pay everyone in full ""—I found upon him this statement of accounts, and a duplicate copy which was handed back 10 his solicitors at the Mansion House by the direction of the official receiver—this statement is prepared, but not sworn to [MR. OLIVER objected to it as not being evidence, it not being sworn to, but the COURT said that it was admissible for what it was worth. MR. PARTRIDGE said he used it us to the statement that the prisoner had not £20 worth of debts at the time of the prosecutor's engagement]—I find in it these amounts stated as owing January 2nd, 1903, £6 18s.; January, 1905, £1; March, £50; January, 1904, £911s. 3d.; June, 1905, £12s. 6d.; then £100, £613s. 6d., £614s. 8d.; £18 6s., £1 15s., £3 18s., £2 6s. 6d., £20 17s. 6d., £1, £12, £12 12s., £20 and others—I do not find that there is any sum like £1,000 due to the prisoner from the Hayling Island property.

Cross-examined. I know now that he also carried on business at Portsmouth; I have had a report from the police there—I did not find that he had a branch at Bristol—I had no information to act upon—I did not find oat that his brother-in-law was managing his Portsmouth business.

Re-examined. The report is not favourable to the prisoner—the police oay that there was a business, and then they go on to say something else.

The prisoner, in his defence on oath, stated that he engaged the prosecutor as clerk but what he had stated as to the conversation was not correct; that he told him he was engaging him to provide a secretary for one of the companies and that the two sums in question were lent to him (the prisoner) voluntarily.

GUILTY . One conviction for embezzlement at the West London Police Court on September 6th, 1902, was proved against him. Twenty-one months' hard labour."
Theft,"JAMES PARKER BOSWELL . I live at 7, South Grove, Mile End—on December 16th last, at about 11 p.m., I was outside Stratford Market station with my wife and sister-in-law, about to get on to a tramcar—as I was doing so I felt the prisoner's hand in my pocket—I turned round and saw him—I got hold of his wrist and in getting off the car to catch him I slipped and he got away—I ran after him and caught him—I gave him into custody—I do not know whether I lost anything from my pocket or not—the prisoner is the right man.

Cross-examined by the prisoner. I was on the step of the car when I caught hold of your wrist—you did not offer me my pipe, as I never had one—I was not intoxicated.

By the COURT. In the pocket where the prisoner put his hand, I had, after I counted it, £1 16s. 6d.

BETSY BOSWELL . I am the last witness's wife—on December 16th, about 11 p.m., I was on the car and my husband was just behind me—I saw him holding the prisoner's arm—I said to him, ""What is the matter?"" He said, ""This man has put his hand in my pocket ""—the prisoner got away—my husband caught him and gave him into custody.

By the COURT. My husband was not intoxicated.

Cross-examined. I was not inside the car at all; I was standing on the footboard—I did not see your hand in his pocket—you handed him

a pipe—I said to you that it did not belong to him because my husband has never smoked a pipe in his life.

CHARLES MANNING (414 K.) I was on duty outside Stratford Market about 11 p.m. on December 16th—I heard a cry of ""Stop thief,"" and saw the prosecutor had hold of the prisoner—the prosecutor gave him in charge—the prisoner said, ""The idea your saying that; he has made a mistake. I am a respectable man ""—I took him to the station—he was charged and made no reply.

Cross-examined. On the way to the station the prosecutor said a lot to you—he said he would punch your head—he had had a drink or two.

The prisoner's statement before the Magistrate: ""I can prove that I have been at work all the time I have been at home. ""

The prisoner, in his defence, said that there were twenty or thirty people trying to get on to the car, and that the prosecutor had made a mistake.

GUILTY . A conviction of felony at Gloucester Quarter Sessions on October 10th, 1902, was proved against him in the name of George Jameson. It was stated that that was after nine convictions for felony. Twelve months hard labour."
Theft,"HENRY BEAOHY (Detective, City). On January 18th I was in Liverpool Street about 6 p.m., and saw the prisoners outside the Great Eastern Railway station gates—there were a great quantity of people there and the prisoners were mixing with them as they were walking along—I saw Smith follow a woman, Johnson being close behind, and Smith put his hands in front of him and fumble in the folds of the woman's dress—I was about half a yard away and Detective Burgess was a little way behind me; he could not see what I saw—the prisoners followed the woman about half a dosen yards—they went into the station and came back to the gates again, but I saw Smith go to another woman while Johnson was close behind him—Smith put his hands in the folds of the lady's dress—Johnson was then beside him—they left that woman and went across to New Broad Street, where the 'buses start—Smith went up to a woman who was waiting for a 'bus and put his left hand into the folds of her dress, Johnson standing beside—they left that woman and followed some others to Broad Street station, where I saw Smith go behind one of the women and put his hand into the folds of her dress, Johnson being close beside him—nothing was extracted to my knowledge—they left that woman and went back to the Great Eastern Railway station—they went inside, but did not take a ticket—Smith did the same thing there, Johnson being close beside him, and they then went to the 'bus-stand again—they went into the station three times while I was watching them—they did not appear to have any business there—I saw them do the same thing in New Broad Street—I was watching them for about twenty-five minutes—

I then left the observation to Burgess and I kept in the rear, watching Burgess, and from what he told me we arrested the prisoners—we charged them and Smith said, ""You have made a mistake""—Johnson said nothing.

Cross-examined by Johnson. We used our discretion as to whether we should apprehend you after making so many attempts—we made an inquiry of a lady, but she had lost nothing.

Cross-examined by Smith. I saw you by the station gates, behind a lady, with both your hands in front of you, fumbling with her dress—I was just behind Johnson—I did not see you extract anything—after that you followed another lady and repeated the same attempt—I was about half a yard away and you were behind the lady—I did not say at the Police Court that you were at the side—I saw you repeat the same attempt—I was not very far away then—I left the observation to Burgess to twenty-five or thirty minutes and I was watching him.

JOSEPH BURGESS (Constable, City). On January 18th, about 6 p.m., I was with Beachy—I first saw the prisoners together at Liverpool Street railway station entrance—Beachy was with me—I saw nothing done while he had them under observation, but I took them under observation shortly after 6.30—before that I was following Beachy, but could not see the prisoners—when I took them under observation I saw Smith in Broad Street, following a lady across to the Great Eastern Railway entrance, and when in the thick of the crowd by the gates he lifted his overcoat with his right hand inside it—Johnson was on his left side and Smith's hand went into the folds of the lady's dress—I was within a yard of them—I went back after the prisoners into Broad Street—they brought another lady over and carried out a similar thing in the gateway, Smith putting his hands precisely as before and Johnson being on his right side—they left that lady and went into Liverpool Street station and I saw Smith get hold of his overcoat again as he had done previously, place his right hand in the folds of the lady's dress, Johnson standing on his right—they left that lady and came back into Liverpool Street, crossed into New Broad Street, where they followed another lady into Liverpool Street, and when outside the gate entrance in the thick of the crowd Smith again got hold of his overcoat behind the lady's dress, Johnson again coming up on the right side—Smith was covering the back of the lady's dress with his coat and Johnson was in such a position that if a purse had been taken it could readily have been passed to him, and that was the case on each occasion—they left that lady and went into New Broad Street and came back behind another lady, when Smith in New Broad Street held out his overcoat and in the thick of the crowd placed his hands in it and Johnson came up beside him—they left that lady, went back into New Broad Street, followed another lady and crossed into Liverpool Street, where they committed another offence in exactly the same way—I then followed them back into New Broad Street, where they followed another lady to the North London Railway—Smith held his overcoat in the same way as before and Johnson came up on his right—Johnson was not long

anything except standing on his right—I arrested them in company with Beachy after I had told them what I had seen taking place.

Cross-examined by Smith. I was about a yard from you when you attempted to pick the first lady's pocket and Johnson was touching me every time he came up to you—I could see your hands in the folds of the lady's dress.

Johnson, in his defence, said that he was in Liverpool Street on this night, but that the evidence of the officers was entirely false; that it was not reasonable that two detectives would watch two men for three-quarters of an how and see them make twelve or thirteen attempts on ladies and not call the ladies forward as witnesses.

Smith, in his defence, said that it was not feasible for a man to be at the side of another and see his hands in a lady's dress as described.

NOT GUILTY ."
Royal Offences,"FREDERICK BLIGH (Detective, City). On January 5th I was with Detective Butcher in Aldersgate Street, when I saw the prisoner standing by Jewin Street, which runs into Aldersgate Street—I followed him from there to Fenchurch Street, when he stopped by a shop window and took a number of coins from his pocket and examined them—this was abort 4 p.m.—I had followed him for quite a mile and a quarter, and noticed him looking about as though he were looking for someone and stopping now and again—I went up to him and said, ""I am a police officer and I suspect you of having counterfeit coin in your possession""—he said, ""Counterfeit coin! What do you mean?""—I held out my hand and said, ""Give me those counterfeit coins you have got in your pocket""—he said, ""I have only a few coppers,"" and at the same time he pat his hand in his left-hand jacket pocket—as he refused to withdraw it I put my hand in and took out 2s. 11 3/4 d. in bronze—in his trousers pocket I

found 14s. in silver, made up of shillings and sixpences—he then put his kind in his right-hand vest pocket and said, ""All right; I will give in. You may as well have them now,"" and he took out four counterfeit florins which he gave me; two of them were bent—he pulled out two more counterfeit florins from other pockets, one of them being wrapped in paper—I took him to the station, where he was charged—he gave no address I examined the papers found in his possession and found a slip of paper with an address at Canning Town on it—I went there and found he resided there with his parents—I was searching the premises when two men entered and went to the back of the house—I followed and bond three men fitting up a blacksmith's forge, and anvil and a furnace—I recognised one of the men as the man I had seen with the prisoner on a previous occasion—I had not Been the prisoner pass any bad money—when he was charged with possessing these four counterfeit coins with intent to utter them he made no reply—he said before the Lord Mayor, ""I was out of work and a man asked me to buy them.""

GEORGE BUTCHER (Detective, City). I was with Bligh on January 5th—at the station, while waiting to be charged, the prisoner said, ""What do you think I shall get? I shall plead guilty.""

WILLIAM JOHN WERSTER . I am Inspector of Coin at His Majesty's Mint—these four florins are counterfeit and from the same mould—they are unusually good imitations.

The prisoner said before the Magistrate: ""I was out of work and I had the offer of buying them. I plead guilty.""

GUILTY . Three months' hard labour."
Royal Offences,"GEORGE BAKER , Inspector, K. Division. I was in Brunswick Street, Poplar, on 10th February and saw prisoner with another man, not in custody. Prisoner took a coin from the purse produced, and handed it to the other man. I can identify the actual purse. The other man entered 67, Brunswick Road, which is a small sweet and tobacco shop, and bought something. I could not see what it was. He left the shop and joined prisoner again. They saw me and both ran in different directions. I followed prisoner, who ran about half a mile through various streets. I caught him in Wilson Street. Just before I caught him he was by the side of a wall which abuts on 14, Dewberry Street. He took this purse from his pocket and threw it over the wall. Then I caught him. A constable came up a few minutes afterwards, on hearing my whistle. I said to prisoner ""I suspect you are in possession of counterfeit coin; I am going to search you."" Prisoner said, ""All right"" I searched him and found four sixpences and 1s. 6 1/2 d. in bronze, all good money. I said, ""There is a purse gone over this wall."" I took him into the yard at the back of the wall, and searched the yard. I did not find the purse, and I left the officer in charge. I told P.C. White in prisoner's presence there were some counterfeit coins somewhere about. Prisoner said nothing. I took him to the station. I then went to the shop at 67, Brunswick Street and examined the till, and saw a counterfeit shilling there. (Produced and handed to the Jury.) Later on I went to Arcadia Street, and found prisoner did not reside there. That was the address he had given me. I came back and told prisoner,""You do not live at Arcadia Street."" He said, ""No; I live at 17, Clifton Street,"" I went to 17, Clifton Street, Limehouse, and searched prisoner's room, which was pointed out to me by Elizabeth Brown. Between the mattresses of prisoner's bed I found this shilling (produced), which is also counterfeit, wrapped in tissue paper. The purse was handed to me by P.C. White at the station. I showed the purse and coins to prisoner and told him the purse had been found in the yard at the back of the wall where he was arrested. He said, ""All right."" I said, ""You will be charged with possessing these counterfeit coins and also uttering one at 67, Brunswick Street."" I showed him the coin I found and told him I had found it between the mattresses. He made no answer.

ROSE CROFT . I live at 67, Brunswick Street, Poplar. It is a shop where tobacco and sweets are sold. On 10th February a man came in and handed me the shilling produced. It was about 3.30 o'clock. I handed the man either tobacco or cigarettes and about 8 1/2 d. or 10d. change.

ELIZABETH ALLEN , wife of Samuel Allen, of 16, Jubilee Street, Poplar. I saw over the wall of my back yard a policeman I now know is named White looking about. I looked about in my yard and found the purse produced. I did not open it. It was upside down and open. I gave it to the policeman.

FREDERICK WHITE (P.C. 416 K.). I heard a police whistle on Saturday afternoon, February 10th, and in consequence went and saw Detective Baker with the prisoner in custody. Baker pointed out the wall to me and I searched the yard inside the wall. I saw Mrs. Elizabeth Allen in her yard, adjoining the yard in which I was looking. She handed me the purse produced. I opened it and found fourteen counterfeit coins in it. I handed them over to Baker.

ELIZABETH BROWN , wife of Frank Brown, of 17, Clifton Street, Poplar. Prisoner has occupied a room at my house since October. I saw Detective Baker at our place, in February, and pointed out room in which prisoner used to sleep. I saw Baker look under the bed and between the mattresses; he found a bad shilling.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , Inspector of Counterfeit Coins to the Royal Mint. The sixteen shillings produced are all counterfeit from the same mould. From one plaster of Paris mould as many as fifty coins could be made.

PRISONER (not on oath). I have been worried by certain men to go round with them. On October 10th I knocked off work at two o'clock. I saw one of the men, who asked me to go somewhere with him; I said, ""Have you any bad money with you?"" He said, ""Yes, I have a bad shilling"" Then I said, ""I will not go with you"" He said, ""Will you leave it in your house till I come back?"" I said ""Yet,"" and I went and stuffed it under the bed.

Evidence for Defence.

ELIZABETH BROWN , re-called. (By prisoner.) I know chaps have been round after you about three times a week; I know you have been trying to get an honest living since you came out and they would not let you alone.

Cross-examined. I cannot say who the men are, but they were mixed up with prisoner when he was looked up before; I cannot describe what men they were, but I know they were no good. They were the men he was locked up with before.

Verdict, Guilty.

Police evidence proved a conviction of the prisoner on the 29th May last for unlawfully uttering counterfeit coin; in April, 1905. prisoner was arrested at Battenea for uttering a counterfeit florin, but, only one coin being* found on him, he was discharged; he is a silversmith and understands the qualities of metal, and is associated with a lot of coiners; he lives in a centre where there are many coiners; his knowledge as a silver refiner assists in helping to make coins.

Sentence, Four years' penal servitude."
Deception,"WARDE, Ernest Vivian (51, secretary), pleaded guilty to being a public officer of a certain public company, called the Twentieth Century Club, Limited, did take and apply to his own use and benefit a large number of cheques, the property of the club, and with having falsified the books.

Mr. Bodkin and Mr. Travers Humphreys prosecuted. Mr. George Elliott appeared for the prisoner.

Police evidence. Prisoner is a very dangerous criminal, and has been for many years. On November 6th, 1896, he was sentenced to eighteen months' hard labour for forgery. Under the name of Francis Tillett he was convicted on 20th September, 1875, when twenty years of age, for felony of stealing notes and

money at this Court and received five years' penal servitude. He was bankrupt in 1889 for £52.000. On his release in 1879' from five years' penal servitude he entered the employment of a corn merchant at Andover. He remained there for some time, giving every satisfaction, and eventually married his employer's sister. His employer then set him up in business as a wine merchant in Piccadilly, and advanced him altogether £13, 000, which he was unable to obtain back, and eventually had to go bankrupt himself. He again lent prisoner £4,250 on the strength of two promissory notes, with which the prisoner waa charged with forging, and that ruined his brother-in-law altogether. He failed in the wine business for £52, 000. Since April last he has been obtaining a quantity of goods in connection with the London County Club by leading various tradesmen to believe that Mr. George Herring was connected with that club, the name of Mr. Herring, who is interested in philanthropic enterprises, being quite sufficient to obtain unlimited credit. Police did not know whether he paid 12s. dividend in the bankruptcy. The London County Club is a genuine institution, with a number of ladies boarding there, and is a going concern at the present time, but prisoner is bankrupt now in connection with that club. The club is still going on. It is true that prisoner's, wife is paralysed and is seriously ill. Sentence, Five years' penal servitude."
Royal Offences,"EDWARD SWAIN . I keep a coffee-stall in Somers Town, at the corner of Ossulston Street. On the early morning of February 23 Smith came to my stall and asked for two cigars and a packet of Bandmaster cigarettes; these were supplied; cost, 5d. He tendered a coin, saying: ""Half a sovereign,"" and I gave him 9s. 7d. change. I had received no other half-sovereign that night. I put the coin in the basin; in the morning, on counting the takings, I found this was a Jubilee sixpence; then I communicated with the police.

Cross-examined. I do not remember having had bad coins passed at my stall before. The coin in question was very like a half-sovereign and I was deceived. I have known, Fuller as a customer, not Smith. Neither has given me a false coin before. Fuller is a coffee-stall keeper; Smith helps him.

CHARLES GOODCHILD . Detective-Sergeant, Y Division. On February 25, at 9.30 a.m., I saw Smith at the Police Station. I said: ""I am a, police-officer, and am making inquiries respecting a gilded sixpence which it is alleged you uttered to a coffee-stall keeper at Ossulston Street on February 22 and obtaining the sum of 9s. 7d. by false pretences."" I showed him the com. He said: ""No, master, I have never seen it before; I was never at the coffee-stall and know nothing whatever about it."" At Somers-Town Station Smith was identified by Swain. After Smith was put in the cell he sent for me. He said: ""I have told you a lie. I am an honest man and wish to tell you the truth."" I then cautioned him, and he went on to male this statement, which I took down, and which he signed.""I have been assisting Fuller at the Royal Cafe in Euston Road for the past two months. On the 22nd inst. I was in the car; Fuller called me and showed"" me a gilded coin, saying, 'What do you think of this; is it a genuine one or not?' I said, 'I have my doubts,' and asked him for a knife to try the edge. I cut the edge of the coin, and said to him, 'I think you have been done this time, this is not a half-sovereign.' Another man in the car said it was a Jubilee tanner. Fuller said, 'I took it off a customer.' He gave me a description, of a man, and I went out to find him, and failed to do so. I returned to the cafe and told Fuller I

had spoken to a constable on the Midland railway station about it, and the constable informed me that several coins had been passed at the refreshment bars at the Crystal Palace recently. Fuller said, 'What do you think, shall I try and pay it in with my money to my master this morning?' I said, 'No, very likely he would give you the sack for taking the coin.' Fuller then handed me the coin, and said, ""Suppose you try and pass it at Smith's? (Smith's is the name Swain's stall is known by.) I said, 'I will try.' I went to the stall and asked for two cigars and a packet of cigarettes, and placed the coin on the counter. Prosecutor served me, and, after sounding the coin, gave me 9s. 7d. change. I went back to Fuller; he said, 'Well, how did you get on?' I said, 'He took the coin and sounded it, and gave me 9s. 7d. and two cigars and a packet of cigarettes, and never said a word.' I handed Fuller the cash and two cigars, and gave him a penny for my cigarettes. He gave me one of the cigars for my trouble, and said, 'Suppose Smith (Swain) came here and asked us about the coin? I said, 'Well, that's another thing; we shall have to tell him all about it then.'"" After this I saw Fuller, and told him Smith had made a statement, and took him to the station. I showed him the coin. He said, ""Yes, that is the coin I sent him with. I took it from a customer in the car. A cabman was present, and remarked that the coin was a gilded one. I lost 9s. 10d. by taking it, and could not afford to lose it; it was a silly thing for me to do, I daresay."" Subsequently, Fuller signed a statement in which, after setting out his career in the army, and that he still belongs to the reserves, he said: ""I received this coin which resembles half a sovereign from a customer whom I should know if I saw him again, and I paid him in return 9s. 10d. change, nearly all the silver I had at the time. Wanting change for other customers, I sent my friend Smith for change with this coin, as I had no doubt whatever respecting it, although the person who tendered same seemed a doubtful character. When my friend returned I asked him if the coffee-stall keeper made any remark about the coin? He informed me 'No, only he asked if I had anything smaller. There is practically nothing against my friend, as he only done a favour by taking the coin to change. There was no intent to defraud whatever.""

Cross-examined. On searching prisoners no false coins were found on either.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , Inspector of Counterfeit Coins to the Royal Mint. The coin produced is a gilded sixpenny piece.

(Evidence for defence.)

ARTHUR JAMES FULLER . (Prisoner on oath.) On the night of February 22 someone came to my car or stall, called for a cup of tea and some cake (cost 2d.), and put down a coin that I

took for a half-sovereign; I gave him 9s. 10d. change. Being doubtful, I showed the coin to a cabman who was in the oar; he said, ""This is a Jubilee half-sovereign; I wish I had a hatful of them."" I showed the coin to Smith; he thought it was a good one; he tried it round the edge with a knife. Another customer came in, and I wanted change; I sent Smith to the next stall, where we often send if we want change. Smith came back and said the coin had been changed without any remark. I then thought that there could be no doubt about it, but that the coin was a good one.

Cross-examined. I did not say when arrested,""A cabman who was present said it was a gilded tanner ""; the cabman amid it was a good half-sovereign; in fact, he offered to change tt for me. I did say when arrested,""It was a silly thing for me to do, I am very sorry ""; when they arrested me for it I thought how silly it was. Smith hat been assisting me, looking after, cups, and so on, outside the stall. We are good friends. I talked with him about the, coin because I thought it was lights and it looked bright and new. He did not say to me,""I think you have been done this time, this is not a half-sovereign."" No one in the car said it was a gilded tanner. The cabman, I refer to is not here. I deny that I said the Smith,""Shall I try to pay this in with my money to my master in the morning,"" or that he said, ""No, very likely he would give you the sack for taking the coin."" I don't know why Smith should have invented this.

CECIL CHARLES VICTOR VIDALLI FITZGERALD SMITH . (Prisoner on oath.) Fuller passed me the coin and asked me what I thought of it; I told him I had my doubts; I tried the edge of it with a knife. I left the stall to try to find the man who had passed the coin. I spoke to a constable at the station opposite, who told me that several Jubilee sixpences had recently been tendered for half-sovereigns at the Crystal Palace. I came back and told this to Fuller; there was a cabman present in the car; I did not hear Fuller speak to the cabman. Fuller sent me out with, the coin to get change; I went to prosecutor's stall, got the change, and brought it back to Fuller. When I passed the coin I had no doubt of its genuineness.

Cross-examined. I was doubtful about the coin at the beginning, but not at the end. When I was arrested I did not say to Goodchild,""No, master, I have never seen that coin in my life before ""; I said I had never tendered the coin. When I saw Good child afterwards in the cell I said, ""It is a lie what I have told you; I did tender half a sovereign as I thought"" At to why I did not say that when I was first arrested, I suppose I was excited; and the charge was never explained to me. I am not say to Fuller,""I think you have been done this time, this is not a half-sovereign."" Fuller did not say to me,""Shall I try and pay this in with my money to my master in the morning?"" I remember that a cabman who was in the car said, ""This is a

Jubilee half-sovereign."" I do not remember another man saying, ""It is a gilded tanner."" These things are in the statement I signed; that statement was written down by Goodchild and read over to me, and I signed lit, but I was excited at the time. When I got back with the change Fuller asked me whether any remark had been made about the coin. When I tendered the coin to Swain I did not say ""half a sovereign ""; I simply put it down, and he asked me if I had any smaller change.

Verdict, Not guilty."
Theft,"Mr. B. A. Smith prosecuted; Mr. Wildey Wright defended.

ETTIE GRUNWALD (through an interpreter). 5, Mulberry Street, Mile End. I received cheque (produced) on Saturday, March 10, and put it in a box. On March 17 I looked for it and could not

find it. I then went to the bank and saw the cheque. It was not endorsed by me. I cannot write.

Cross-examined. I occupy one room on first floor in a large house of six rooms. About eight or nine other persons live there. When I go out I leave the key with the landlord. Prisoner is a stranger to me. I went to Ginsberg, the money changer, on Sunday, the 18th, and Monday, the 19th. He was about to throw me out. He told me there came a man and changed the cheque—that was all.

(Thursday, April 5.)

ETTIE GRUNWALD (recalled) further cross-examined. I received the cheque at night, on March 10. I went marketing on Sunday morning, March 11, from ten to one or half-past one. I received similar cheque once every two months. It is rather a rough neighbourhood.

ABRAHAM GINSBERG , 116, Brick Lane, money changer. On Sunday evening, March 11, prisoner brought cheque (produced) and asked me to change it for his mother, as his mother was not well. I gave him £2 18s. 6d. for it. I do not remember his saying where the cheque had come from. I had not seen prisoner before. He gave me his address, which was written down by my clerk in my presence.

Cross-examined. It is a common practice for me to change cheques. I recognise prisoner by his face. He might have been in my office two minutes. San Francisco is put in my book because the envelope has San Francisco on it. Prisoner did not bring me another cheque in an envelope with San Francisco on it for £2 1s. 1d. Every transaction is booked in this book. My clerk did not say to Sussmann in my presence that this cheque was changed by Lewis Levensbill, of 29, Cable Street, St. George's-in-the-East.

Re-examined. Every transaction would be in this book. There is no entry of a transaction of £2 1s. 1d. I identified prisoner amongst 10 or 12' persons at the police station. I am positive he is the man who changed the cheque produced on March 11.

MAX COHEN , clerk to Abraham Ginsberg. About eight be nine in the evening of March 11 I saw prisoner at the office. He said his mother had received the cheque and could not come herself, and he wanted to exchange it. Mr. Ginsberg gave him £2 18s. 6d. I wrote the entry in the book. I wrote San Francisco because the prisoner said his mother had received it from San Francisco, as far as I remember. I had never seen prisoner before. At the police station I picked him out of 10 or 12 of her persons. I am sure that is the man.

Cross-examined. I saw no document on March 11. I do not. remember saying at the police court the prisoner produced a

pink envelope. He produced an envelope, and I saw it from afar. I did not tell Sussmann that the cheque was changed by Lewis Levensbill, 29, Cable Street, St. George's-in-the-East. I never heard that name. I saw the prisoner in the dock at the police court, and then a week after I identified him among a number of other persons. I wrote the name and address on card produced in the presence of the prisoner.

HENRY SMITH , cashier, London and River Plate Bank. Cheque produced for £3 was received at my bank on March 13 in ordinary course of business.

FREDERICK GOODING , detective, H Division. I arrested prisoner at 20, Yalford Street, for stealing a cheque and cashing it with Ginsberg. He said, ""I did change one last week for £2 1s. 1d. My mother sent me to change it. This is the envelope it came in from America."" This is the envelope he showed me. There was a letter inside it.

Cross-examined. There is no conviction against prisoner at present. I have seen him in very dubious company. He has only done three months' work in three years.

MORRIS JACOBS (prisoner, on oath). I live at 20, Yalford Street. I am a tailor, working for my father. I cannot read. I have never seen cheque produced. I can only write a few words in Russian and sign my name in English. My mother received a cheque for £2 1s. 1d. from my brother Lewis, in San Francisco, which I took to the prosecutor, who gave me £2 0s. 7d. for it. I have never been charged with any offence. I worked for four months for Mr. Carbury, 24, Greenfield Street. I worked for Cohen, tailor, about a year. He gave me a good character.

Cross-examined. I changed the cheque for £2 1s. 1d. at Ginsberg's about two months ago. My mother's name is Kayler Jacobs. In Yiddish her name is Yankelow. I have two brothers in America besides Lewis, who is in San Francisco, and one brother in London. Envelope produced I got from my mother when arrested, and gave it to the policeman. It had a letter in it. I am 17, and have been four years in England.

KAYLER YANKELOW or JACOBS (through an interpreter). I live at 20, Yarford Street, with my husband, and am the mother of the prisoner. My son Lewis at San Francisco every six or eight months sends me a cheque. Envelope produced is mine. It came to me with a letter and cheque produced for £2 1s. 1d.

At this point the Jury stopped the case and found a verdict of Not guilty."
Theft,"ELLA KERRIDGE , clerk to the Coal Supply Association, of 6, Vincent Square Mansions. On April 7 I went to the Churton Street Post Office to obtain a foreign money order for £4 3s. 10d.; I paid £4 4s. 10d., and received a form to fill up, which I took back to our office. The money I put underneath the brass rail on the counter, four sovereigns, and the rest in silver and bronze.

ALICE SWAN , clerk at Churton Street Post Office. I remember the last witness coming in on April 7 just alter ten in the morning, and leaving with me £4 4s. 10d.; I pulled the money through the brass rail to my side of the counter. Prisoner came in and offered to sell me some bootlaces. While I was looking at the bootlaces my fellow-clerk, Miss Lane, called out that he had taken my money. Prisoner ran out of the office, and I ran alter him and raised an alarm, and he was caught. I am certain this is the men.

To Prisoner. The office was quite empty at the time.

LILIAN LANE , clerk at Churton Street Post Office. I remember prisoner coming into the office; there was no one else there at the time on the public side. While he was talking to Miss. Swan I saw him put his hand under the brass rail; he took up some money and rushed out. I called out to Miss Swan, ""The man has taken your money,"" and she ran out after him. I am sure prisoner is the man.

To Prisoner. I was half a yard away from Miss Swan; it is not true that I was four yards away at the other end of the office.

JAMES CROSBY , hotel lift attendant, 33, Hanover Street, Pimlico. On April 7, at 20 past 10, I was walking up Churton Street, when I saw prisoner rush out of the post office; he was followed by two ladies, who shouted ""Stop thief ""; I ran after prisoner, also crying out, and saw prisoner stopped. I saw him put his hand over his shoulder, and throw something away; I cannot say what it was; there were road repairs going on, and whatever it was it made no noise.

To Prisoner. I did not say at the police court that I saw you throw ""coins"" away; you threw something, I cannot tell what.

WILLIAM FERGUSON , furniture dealer, 203, Vauxhall Bridge Road. On April 7 I heard people crying,""Stop thief,"" and saw prisoner running, and I stopped him. He went to raise his hand, but I did not see anything go out of his hand; it seemed to me as if he was beckoning to somebody, because there were some workmen in the road looking at him.

FRANCIS HEPBURN , a schoolboy. On April 7 I saw prisoner running along Vauxhall Bridge Road, and a crowd crying, ""Stop thief ""; I saw last witness catch him. I saw prisoner put his hand over his shoulder, and as soon as he had done that a workman on the tramline stooped down and put something in his pocket.

SAMUEL LEWIS (P. C., 170 B). Prisoner was given into my custody on April 7 in Vauxhall Bridge Road, and charged with stealing £2 0s. 3d.; he said he did not do it; no money was found on him; he had one pair of laces; asked for his address, he gave ""No fixed abode."" He made no statement before the magistrate.

PRISONER (not on oath). I am not guilty. I admit I was in the post office; I went there to try to sell some bootlaces to buy some tobacco. My brother happened to be passing, and he called me. I left the post office and as I left there was a lady there, a well-dressed female, with an umbrella. I ran to overtake my brother; as I was running there were cries of ""Stop thief,"" and I was stopped and arrested. When I was searched they found no money on me.

To the Court I cannot say what became of the female; she disappeared.

Miss SWAN and Miss LANE, recalled, repeated that no one was in the public part of the office except prisoner.

Verdict, Guilty. Prisoner pleaded guilty to a conviction at Marlborough Street Police Court, in January last, for felony, in the name of Donovan; and the police further proved a conviction in 1904. Sentence, Eight months' hard labour."
Miscellaneous,"ROSENBERG, Fanny (22), was indicted for the murder of her newly-born female child; the Grand Jury having ignored the bill as regards the charge of murder, prisoner was proceeded against for concealment of birth.

Mr. A. E. Gill and Mr. Leycester prosecuted; Mr. Burnie (at the request of the court) represented prisoner.

GEORGE WILLIS , 168, H. On March 18 I went to 13, Casson Street, with Police-constable Hawkins about six in the evening, and, accompanied by a Mrs. Bernstein, entered a back room on the ground floor. I saw prisoner sitting on the bed. Rebekah Lewis was present. I asked Rosenberg what was the matter. She shrugged her shoulders. Rebekah Lewis said, ""What do you mean?"" and pointed to something on the bed. I went round to the other side of the bed and saw a red petticoat lying on the bed outside the clothes. I turned it over and saw the child wrapped in a blouse, one sleeve of which was tied tightly round the neck. I undid the knot, turned the blouse back, and saw the child. A handkerchief was stuffed in its mouth, and a small piece of it was hanging out. I pulled it out, at the same time saying to Rosenberg,""Who did this?"" She replied: ""I did."" I then sent for the divisional surgeon. The body was cold.

Mr. Justice JELF. Is that the only evidence of the secret disposition of the body of the child?

Mr. Gill said that was the only evidence. The woman appeared to have been in the room by herself when she was confined.

Mr. Justice Jelf thought the mere covering of the body did not amount to secret disposition.

Mr. Gill admitted that the facts here went beyond any case decided hitherto. The nearest case was where the child was covered by a bolster.

Mr. Justice Jelf said this seemed to him to be carrying the

case further than such a case had ever been carried. The more fact of covering the body with a petticoat was not sufficient. There was a case of Reg. v. Perry (Dears, 471), where the body was put between the bed and the mattress, which might be co mpared to putting it into a box, as it was a place which might not be examined, and afforded an opportunity of removal and final disposition at a later time. That and the bolster case (Reg. v. Goldthorpe, 2 Mood. C. C., 244) were the nearest to this; but he did not think it right to extend the principle to this case. It was, of course, a very suspicious case; but the larger charge had been quite properly thrown out by the Grand Jury, the child being an eight months' child, and the surgeon being unable to say positively that there had been separate existence. Apart from grave suspicion, and looking at the matter as a question under the Statute, the ingredient of secretly disposing of the body of the child was wanting.

By direction of the judge the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, and no evidence was offered upon the coroner's inquisition."
Deception,"FREDERICK WALKER , 202, Cornwall Road, Kensington, dealer in fancy goods. I employed prisoner as a traveller on September 11, 1905, under the following written agreement: ""I, Hanns Sulry, of 19, Charles Street, Paddington, W., agree to represent F. Walker, 202, Cornwall Road, Notting Hill, W., as a traveller upon £1 per week wages having turned £5 over first, and all orders over £5 I shall receive 5 per cent. commission on all cash paid in. He shall solely represent me only and my goods. He shall be paid per week, and shall give one clear week's notice on leaving. All samples bought by him must be paid for. I agree to act upon these terms—Hanns Sulry."" That is my writing, and prisoner signed it. It was verbally said that he should account for the moneys received every day. On November 5 he called on me. I told him to bring his bag in next morning to be checked. He did not do so. I received a card saying be bed received Morris's account. He was carrying stock for sale to the value of about £20. On November 13 he wrote me a card saying,""I have sent your bag with Carter, Paterson, and Co."" He never called on me after November 5, and after making inquiries I applied for a warrant. Cheques produced for £1 8s. 6d. signed by E. George, and for 9s. 10d. signed by E. M. Jones payable to F. Walker are cheques of my customers. The endorsement ""F. Walker"" is in prisoner's handwriting. Prisoner did not account for those two sums to me. He had no authority to sign my name. I owed him no money whatever.

Cross-examined. I told prisoner when I engaged him to come in each day. On one occasion I told him he need not come because he had an appointment with a customer of his. George was a customer introduced by prisoner. I told prisoner it was not paying me nor paying him and he would have to do more orders or I would have to terminate the agreement. I paid his wages for the first three weeks.

Re-examined. I did not pay his wages after the three weeks because of the turnover. He brought orders in the first week ending September 23 for £7 19s. 6d., of which only £1 8s. 3d. was genuine; for the week ending September 30 £5 17s., of which none were genuine; for the week ending October 7 £4 6s. 2d., of which £1 0s. 6d. were genuine. The other orders were bogus ones. When I paid him the first and second week I did not know that those were bogus orders. I found that out after the warrant had been issued. I did not pay him the

fourth week because he had obtained no orders and I did not owe him anything.

OWEN GWYNNE JONES , 20, Carlton Road, Battersea, draper. I paid prisoner cheque produced for 9s. 10d. on October 23 for goods received. The cheque has been paid at the bank.

VALENTINE GEORGE , 120, West Ames Lane, West Hampstead, hairdresser. I gave prisoner cheque produced for £1 8s. 6d. in payment for goods received at the time from the prisoner. It has been cashed at the bank.

CONSTANTINE STARR , 182, Albany Street, hairdresser. Prisoner brought me cheque produced for 9s. 10d., and I gave him cash for it to oblige him, as he said he had no bank account. I have known him eight or ten months as a traveller. I also gave prisoner cash for the cheque produced, £1 8s. 6d.

WILLIAM BURRILL , Sergeant, X Division. When prisoner was charged with forging the endorsement on two cheques he asked to see the cheques. I handed them to him, and he said, ""Yes, they are the two cheques I gave to Mr. Starr—that is my writing on the back.""

PRISONER (not on oath). Mr. Walker engaged me at a weekly wage of £1 as soon as ever I turned over £5. He said he would pay me 5 per cent. commission on all orders that I brought him. I took £5 in orders and he paid me the sovereign a week, and, through my taking the £5 of orders, he had, according to the contract, to pay me £1 every week. The first three weeks Mr. Walker paid me 20s. Then he sent me a letter, in which he wrote that he could not pay me any longer the 20s. a week unless I took £5. I did not answer this letter because I kept to my contract. He paid me that week no wages at all. The following week he said to me,""It is no good to you if you are not getting any wages, and I will pay you some wages."" Then afterwards he said.""If you do not bring me more orders I shall have to give you notice."" By reason of that, according to my idea, he had recognised our former contract again and had therefore to pay me every week 20s. He did not give me any notice, but instead had let me work on for him. I worked for him from nine in the morning till the evening. The reason why I could not get more orders was because he had told me that he would only deliver goods on cash payment, and I had to find most of the customers myself, as the number of old customers that I took over to him was very small, and they would not give me any orders for Mr. Walker again. I was firmly convinced that, according to my contract, he had to pay me the 20s. a week. I went twice to him but he did not pay me anything. I did my very best to do as much business as I could for him with the idea that he would then pay me my wages. Goods that were given to me by prosecutor were on my own account. I either had to pay

for them or else give them back; therefore the goods I sold to Mr. George were really my goods, and the cheque that he paid me belonged to me, and also the 19s. 6d. that Mrs. Morris paid me. I gave notice of that to Mr. Walker. I did not pay him the money because he had not reckoned with me and had paid me no wages. For that very same reason I did not give the cheque from Mr. Jones to him. I worked for him from early in the morning till evening, and prosecutor told me,""You cannot pay your rent because I do not give you any money."" I was under the firm conviction that, as we had no settled accounts, I had a perfect right to keep the money. After I had seen that I could not continue to work for Mr. Walker as I was doing no business, I sent him the bag back with nearly all the goods that had been in the bag. Therefore the amount that I had from Mr. Walker was less than the money I had earned—in fact, he was owing me five weeks' wages. I did not think I could come in any way in contact with the law as I looked upon the goods as my own.

FREDERICK WALKER , recalled. Prisoner came to me almost every day for the first three weeks. After that he treated the matter with contempt. I told him he must do the trade. I spoke to him in English, and he understood me, because I cannot speak German. I had no discussion with him about his being paid nothing at all. I asked him when I engaged him if he understood the agreement, and he said he did. When he sent the bag back, out of £20 worth of goods supplied, about £15 worth was missing. Prisoner never asked for wages after the first three weeks.

Verdict, Guilty. The jury stated they thought the agreement was a very harsh one for anybody to work under. Sentence, three months' hard labour. Prisoner certified for expulsion under Aliens Act."
Deception,"COHEN, John Maurice (42, diamond setter) , having been entrusted with two rings and one watch by George Evans for the purpose of pawning the same, did fraudulently convert the proceeds thereof to his own use and benefit.

Mr. Francis Watt appeared for the prosecution.

GEORGE EVANS , 69, Cloudsley Road. Islington, farrier. On Saturday evening, March 24, I was in Goswell Road in a public-house. Prisoner was there; I have known him for a long time. I gave him some money to buy some jewellery. That is the jewellery I charge him with stealing. It was my property. We both bought it; he bought it with my money for me. I lent him money to buy it. It was a gold watch, a diamond ring, and a

signet ring. He bought it of a friend of his in the public-house. I do not know the name of the friend, and I have not seen him since. I asked Cohen to pawn them or sell them, and he said he would. He said he would bring them back or the money in the public-house where I left him. I never did get them. On the next Tuesday I informed the police. I have never seen the articles since.

To the Prisoner. You bought a watch and ring of the man in the public-house and I paid for them. You borrowed 30s. from me to pay for the things. We went from there to the City and you bought a bracelet for 2s. 6d. and a diamond ring. for £1 5s. (The receipt for the diamond ring was produced.) Romaine is where we bought the diamond ring; the other two were bought in the public-house.

To Mr. Watt. I cannot explain how it is that the name is Cohen's and not mine on the receipt.

To the Prisoner. You bought the bracelet for 2s. 6d. and we pawned it for 10s. You gave me my profit out of that.

JAMES SMITH (retired police sergeant). I remember Tuesday, March 29. On the 25th I got information from the prosecutor of a ring and watch not being returned by Cohen. I made some inquiries, and found out where Cohen was living. On the 29th I saw him and told him that I should take him to the police station for stealing two rings and a watch. He said, ""The things are mine."" I took him to the station and he was charged. He asked me if he might ask the prosecutor a question, and that he was not allowed to do.

The judge ruled that there was no case made out, and directed the jury to find a verdict of Not guilty."
Damage to Property,"HARRY FINCH , Milford Cottage, Abingdon Road, Tottenham. On April 22, about one a.m., I was standing with Daisy North, my sweetheart, at the corner of 40, Shrubbery Road, Tottenham; that is about 30 yards from the stable in question. I heard the footsteps of someone going into the stable yard. I looked across, but saw no one then. It was as if someone had jumped the fence; two feet came down on the pavement with a bang. Presently we saw a man walking; he passed us so close that I was able to notice his dress, build, and walk, but I did not recognise him as anyone I knew. It was a wet starless night. He was coming from the direction of the stables, and went down Shrubbery Road. Just as he passed us we noticed flames in the stable downstairs and the reflection of fire in the loft. We followed the man down Shrubbery Road, and he took the first turning on the left; that is a short turning, not

lighted. We lost sight of him altogether. We went through the dark turning into Cornwall Road and looked both ways, but could not see the man. We ran back by the West Green Road to the stables; we saw no flames, but plenty of smoke. I ran to the fire alarm and rang the bell. I had known prisoner before, by sight only; I had seen him two or three times putting away his things at the stable; I did not recognise him at this time. The engines came and I went back to the fire. I saw a police-sergeant come with the prisoner. I went to the station; there I said to prisoner that he must have hidden himself because he could not have got away in such a short time and we were so close behind him. We saw nobody in Cornwall Road except a young couple walking towards West Green Road. I know of no short cut which prisoner could have taken from Shrubbery Road.

Cross-examined. I Had seen prisoner on other Saturday nights, about the same time, putting his barrow back in the stables. At the time we heard the footsteps inside the fence we heard a sound similar to a gate rattling. Before the magistrate I said, ""I looked across and saw the prisoner We followed the prisoner down the road. I lost sight of prisoner."" I did not mean by this that I then recognised this man; I recognised him at the station afterwards. When I saw a man coming away from the stable and run past us I did not call out; I was wonderstruck at the time. When I got to the fire after my chase of the man, Smylie was there; he was trying to get the gates open; I do not think he was struggling to get the barrow out. Between the time I first saw a man leave the stable and the time I rang the alarm the interval was 10 or 15 minutes. The window of the loft through which I saw the reflection of fire is a very small window.

Re-examined. Before the magistrate I think I did not myself use the word ""prisoner""; I used it once at the police court by a slip.

HENRY THOMAS GLASS (police-constable 538 N) produced plans of the immediate neighbourhood and photographs of the stable and loft.

DAISY NORTH , 40, Shrubbery Road, Tottenham. On the early morning of April 22 I was standing in the doorway with my young man, Harry Finch. I heard footsteps in the direction of the stables; we could not see anyone, and took no notice. Then we heard as if someone had jumped to the ground, and the gates rattled. Then we saw flames, and we saw a man come from the direction of the stables towards us; he was not two yards away from the stable gates when I first saw him. He passed us and went straight up the road till he got to the dark court. We followed him; I saw his back, not his face. I did not then recognise him; when the accused came up afterward

with the sergeant I recognised him as the man who had passed us; I knew him by his dress and build and walk. Nobody else had passed us that night. We ran back to the stable to see if the fire was really bad; there was plenty of smoke, but no flames. When the fire first started all I saw was flames coming from the lower window.

Cross-examined. I am sure I had seen flames coming from the window. The footsteps we heard must have been inside the stable fence. I had known accused by sight for three months; I had seen him putting his things in the stable. I noticed flames first, and then I saw accused three yards away; before the magistrate I said eight or nine yards; I can only roughly guess; I did not measure. [Passages in the depositions were put to witness in which she was recorded as saying that she saw ""prisoner,"" followed ""prisoner"" lost sight of ""prisoner"" etc. I do not think I myself used the word ""prisoner""; that it the way my answers were taken down. I did not actually recognise this man until I saw him with the sergeant. When we got back to the fire I saw three or four men there; one may have been Smylie.

SMOLLETT EDDINGTON , Superintendent, Tottenham Fire Brigade. On April 29, at 1.29 a.m., we were rung up, and I proceeded with a steam engine to this fire; a motor chemical engine had already arrived there. I found a very serious fire going on in a brick stable; it had been burning 26 minutes before we got there, and had a good start. On entering, in fact, before I got properly inside, I noticed a strong smell of paraffin; just inside there was that smell very very strong indeed; so much so that I went out and called a police sergeant, and drew his attention to it. On going to the other side, near the pony-stall, there was the same smell again, and I again fetched the sergeant. On searching the place I found the pony dead; it was terribly charred; a dog also dead and charred was lying by its side. There was a great body of flame at the start; the chemical engine quickly got it down; but it kept on re-igniting. That was due unquestionably to the presence of oil, and in a very considerable quantity. There could not have been such a sustained fire unless a large quantity of paraffin had been used. After the fire I found the remains of altogether four naphtha lamp, such as are used on a barrow; the container of one was lying immediately behind where the pony had stood; three others were about where the barrow had been. I do not suggest that these had been purposely left somebody. Outside I found a can that had contained oil. I made every possible search for the remains of any harness, and could find none—not a buckle. After the fire had been put out I had a conversation with prisoner. I asked him whether the contents of the stable were his property; he said,

""Yes."" I said, ""Are they covered with insurance?"" He said, ""Yes, £140, a portion of which is on the pony."" I asked what time he had left there; he said he left the place locked up and quite safe at half past twelve. I said, ""Can you account for the presence of paraffin oil in this fire, because there has been a lot of it?"" He said, ""Yes; I use paraffin oil in my naphtha lamps there would be about a pint or rather under; I put them out in Kingsland Road""; that would be about three miles off. I told him that certain persons had identified him as having been seen leaving the premises after one, and that he had been seen jumping over the fence. He said, ""How could I jump over the fence when I had to bolt the gate. I wish I knew who said so, I would make them prove their words."" I said, ""No doubt an opportunity will be afforded you of doing so."" He said, ""I was outside West Green Station at 12.15; here is a man who can prove what time I returned""; he pointed to Smylie, who said, ""Yes, I can answer for that."" When I was having this talk with him, prisoner seemed a little nervous; he choked rather, once or twice, but I should not say he was excited.

Cross-examined. When I got to the fire the gates were open; my men had been in. The can we found outside would have held not more than a gallon of oil; it was empty. The four lamps, the remains of which we found, were the ordinary flare lamps used on costers' barrows. If these lamps are defective, of course they will leak. Yes, a little paraffin makes a great smell, but a lot of it makes more.

HENRY STALLARD , second officer, Fire Brigade, Tottenham. When I got to the fire the stable was well alight. When I went into the stables I noticed a strong smell of paraffin on the right-hand side of the door. There was a great flame. After the chemical engine had got the fire down, it lit up again; that happened twice. I think; that is the kind of thing we find in paraffin fires. Inside the stable door I found a gallon can; I smelt it, and it evidently had contained paraffin; I placed it outside the door, where the last witness found it. In the stable there were the remains of four naphtha lamps; also a pony and a dog burned to death. Before I got there the barrow had been pulled outside; it was in flames.

Cross-examined. There was straw all about the place.

FRANK BUNN , police-sergeant 92 N. I was at this fire. Eddington called me inside the stable, and I noticed a strong smell of paraffin just inside the crockery store; a bit later he called me in again, and on going to the back of the stable I again noticed a strong smell of paraffin. At the station, while prisoner was being charged, he said, ""What am I being charged for?"" On my reading the charge to him he replied, ""I did

not set about it; I locked up about quarter to one and went home.""

CHARLES BUTTON , police-constable 687 N. On April 22 about 12.15 a.m. I was on point duty in High Road, opposite Seven Sisters Road, when I saw prisoner; he was driving a pony attached to a coster's barrow, going in the direction of West Green Read. I saw him again about quarter past one about opposite St. Anne's Road Police (Station; he was walking towards his home in Victoria Crescent; he was going rather quickly. I was with P.C. Lake. Lake said to prisoner, ""Good night,"" and prisoner replied, ""Good night."" Three minutes after that I heard a whistle blown and saw flames from, this stable. I have known prisoner by sight for four or five years.

Cross-examined. I have known him as a steady, hard-working, respectable man. When I saw him driving there was a lighted lamp on the barrow.

ARTHUR ASSERTON , police-sergeant 90 N. On April 22, at 2.15 a.m., I saw prisoner at his home in Victoria Crescent. I asked him if he occupied stables in Shrubbery Road. He said ""Yes."" I told him there had been a fire there. He said, ""Did they get the pony out?"" I said, ""No."" He said, ""Did they get my barrow out?"" I said, ""Yes, but it was badly burned."" I requested him to come to the stable. I asked him if he was insured. He said ""Yes,"" but he did not know in which company. On arriving at the scene of the fire a statement was made to me by the captain of the fire brigade and two private witnesses in prisoner's presence, and, in consequence, I took him to the station. I asked him if he had extinguished his light before he left the stable. He said, ""Yes; I use an ordinary carriage lamp that hangs at the side of the wall; I blew it out before leaving.""

WILLIAM SOPER , police-inspector, N Division. On April 22 I saw prisoner at the police station with reference to the question of bail. He said, ""I have already asked them for bail, but I am wrongly charged. I misled the insurance company, as to the value of my stuff, but I can assure you I did not set the place alight. I may have dropped a match, and if I did I am sorry for it. On searching the stable next day I found the remains of a very small carriage lamp, practically destroyed by fire. I also saw the naphtha lamps and oil can spoken to by previous witnesses.

FREDERICK IVED SHEFFIELD , loss clerk to the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company. I produce policy taken out by prisoner on April 18, 1904. It insured goods at that time at 149, West Green Road, By an endorsement of March 24, 1906, the address is altered to 16, Clinton Road. The insurance is for £20 on a pony and harness, £15 on a cart, £5 on a barrow, and £100

on stock-in-trade. The premium is 5s. 6d. per annum; the lowest premium we accept is 3s.

Superintendent EDDINGTON, recalled (by Mr. Purcell). I examined the loft, and found nothing except a box, which was charred, and a dead dog—suffocated.

Prisoner's statement to magistrate. ""I am not guilty. What I told the sergeant is true. I did not set light to it. I had lamps and straw there in the ordinary business way, and also the oil. I have stored them there in the same way for the last four or five months, ever since I have been there, and also at my previous place, and the place before that. I knew nothing of the fire till I was called out of bed by my wife. I had the pony for the last five years. The dog was a pet in the family; so was the pony. I have been in this neighbourhood seventeen years, and this is the first time I have ever been accused of anything. I reserve my defence and shall call witnesses at the trial.""

(Evidence for the defence.)

PRISONER (on oath). I am a street seller and job buyer, dealing in china and glass. I have been carrying on that business for six or seven years. In 1904 a close neighbour of mine was burnt out and my stock might have caught fire too; my wife then begged and prayed of me to be insured, and I took out a policy. I pay Smylie 4s. 6d. a week for these stables; I used them for keeping my pony and barrow and my stock Summer time and just before Christmas is my busy time; about April trade would be slack, and I should not have much stock. On this night I drove to the stables as usual. I had on the barrow a colza oil carriage lamp and four naphtha lamps; only the colza lamp was lighted. That night I had only had three out of the four naphtha lamps in use. I filled the lamps as usual on Kingsland Waste. I bought the oil from another coster who hawks oil to all of us down there; I got four half-gallons and half a gallon in the can. When I passed the policeman at 12.15 I had the half-gallon in the can and also the half-gallon in one of the lamps that I had not used. When I got to the stables I unlocked the doors and backed the pony in; then I took the carriage lamp off and hung it on the wall. On the other side there was a candle lamp, which I lit with a match. To get to the stable from where the constable on point duty saw me would take me 10 to 15 minutes; I was at the stables at 12.25 or 12.30. Unharnessing and feeding the pony and so on would take me 20 or 25 minutes. Where I left the can was a place where it might be knocked down by anyone struggling to get the barrow out. I locked up the place from the outside and went home. There is no truth in the suggestion that I jumped over the gate or the fence. Everything was, as I thought, in safety when I left.

In addition to this insurance, I have a policy on my furniture at home, £150.

Cross-examined. In March last I was in the same position as I always am at that time of the year; business is always bad then. I had a County Court judgment out against me, not for £19, but another amount I did not mislead the insurance company as to the amount of my stock; I have had as much as £140 or £160 of stock there; I had not so much in March. The insurance included the harness. I cannot account for the police saying that no trace of the harness has been found; if the leather is not there, the brass work must be; the buckle must be there. I recollect passing Button on my way home, but he is wrong in saying that it was 1.15; it was only just after one. I had put out all the lamps on Kingsland Waste; there may have been some oil left in some of them; there may have been one alight when Button saw me at 12.15. I was in the stables about 20 minutes; I should think it would be about five past one when I left. There was no one there except me; Finch and North must be mistaken in saying they heard footsteps. If anyone else had been in the stables I must have known it. I will swear that no one followed me down Shrubbery Road. This is what I meant by my statement to the inspector about a match; there was no light, in the stable, and I lit the candle lamp hanging on the wall; I admit that I may have dropped the lighted match; I generally put the match in the candlestick, but it is possible that I dropped it this time. When Eddington asked me how much stock there was I said £70 or £80; what I meant was, including barrow, pony, harness, and stock. The can of oil spoken of I took off the barrow and put just inside the stable as I always do. As to accounting for the strong smell of paraffin noticed by the firemen, I can only suppose that the can had got knocked over by someone pulling the barrow out. The only oil in the place was in that can and in the lamp hanging on the wall; if there was paraffin in other places it must have been washed about by the hose.

(Wednesday, May 23.)

HENRY WILLIAM SMYLIE , grocer, West Green. I carry on business at the corner house, Clinton Road and Shrubbery Road. The shop and premises and two houses adjoining belong to me. I rent the stables in Shrubbery Road on a 21 years' lease. They adjoin my garden. I have known prisoner about three years. For about three months I have sublet the stables to him at a rental of 4s. 6d. a week, which he paid regularly. The outer doors of the stables are locked by a padlock with a patent lock. Then there are the street gates of which both Quigley and I had a key. I used the loft of the stables for

keeping grocery and trade utensils. I also kept things in the yard. I know Quigley treated the pony well, and I had often admired it. He also had a little dog which he kept in the stables, and I kept a dog in the loft. On Saturday, April 21, I closed the shop at ten minutes past twelve, and as I was having my supper in the kitchen I heard Quigley go by with his cart. Being familiar with the sound of the passing cart I am sure it was Quigley. Sometime after I had gone to bed I was aroused by knocking at the street door. I went to the window, and saw a customer who lives opposite the stables. He said, ""I believe your stables are on fire."" I put on enough clothes to cover me, and taking the key of the outer gates went to the stables which I found padlocked in the ordinary way. Smoke was issuing above the stable door. I undid them and went to the smaller door inside the yard with the object of getting the pony out. They are two big doors and a smaller door at the side. The big doors were padlocked as usual. I then ran to the outer gates and told a little boy to run and give the alarm, whereupon Finch said, ""I will go; I can go quicker."" I then noticed Finch for the first time. I next got hold of a ladder, and with the assistance of a young man made a charge at the stable doors to see if we could force them, but we made no impression. I then ran across the yard, and asked for a hammer, and they brought me a mason's hammer, and with the first blow the lock flew off and I pulled the doors open. The interior was full of dense smoke, but I could see the barrow with a long board at the top. As I was endeavouring to get the barrow out the smoke seemed to light up into a flame. I noticed that there were lamps on the barrow. I pulled the barrow out half way and then the outer gates closed and jammed it. I then became frightened for myself, and ran off to Avenue Road, where there is a fire alarm. I should say I was away fully ten minutes, and when I came back the barrow was in the road burning round the edge and the firemen were playing on the stable. The day before yesterday Mrs. Quigley asked me if there was any harness in the stable, and I said I would look, and in the search I came across the remains of the burned harness (produced). I should not have allowed anyone to go into the stables without my permission after the salvage man was withdrawn, which I believe was on May 5. I should not have been so arbitrary about the key, but I had written to the insurance company asking if they would undertake the responsibility, they having instructed the landlord to replace the premises, and they replied avoiding the question. I found the harness in the stall near the manger. The hames were hanging on the wall.

Cross-examined. I cannot say at what time prisoner came away from the stables. I should say there was a great deal of

smoke. I did not notice any smell except the ordinary oil smell. Previously to the day before yesterday I had been in the premises several times, but not to make a search. The salvage man was always there. I am not aware that both the police and the salvage people had made a considerable search over the premises to find what there was, and took account of the things that were found. Possession of the premises was given up by Mrs. Quigley on May 5, and since that time I have kept the place and not allowed her to go in. I did not do anything on the occasions when I was present with Superintendent Eddington or the salvage man. The matter did not interest me. I was not covered by insurance myself. I simply went to hear the rights of the case; that was all.

To the Court. The first thing I noticed was smoke coming through the crevice over the door. I did not notice any smell of paraffin then.

Verdict, Not guilty."
Theft,"FREDERICK JAMES WALKHAM , a Midland Railway van-guard. On June 14 I was acting as van-guard to a driver named Grounds; I was standing on the tail-board, in Cannon-street; some parcels were lying near the tail-board. I heard a rustling behind me on the tail-board, and on turning round saw prisoner running along Cannon Street with a parcel in his hand. I called to Grounds to pull up, jumped down, and ran after prisoner. Before I got to the corner of Distaff Lane he came walking out behind a Carter Paterson's van, and I called out to Grounds to stop him. A stranger came up with the parcel, which he said he had found in the street; it was the parcel that had been on the van. Prisoner said, ""It's all right, mate, you have got your parcel.""

Cross-examined by prisoner. I saw you go into Distaff Lane with the parcel, and you came out of the lane without it. I do not know who the stranger is who gave me the parcel.

FREDERICK WALTER GROUNDS . I was driving the van. When Walkham called out I stopped, and saw him run down Distaff Lane. After an interval I saw-prisoner coming out of Distaff Lane, and running up Old Change. I ran after him and caught him in Watling Street. Then a man came up and gave us a parcel. The parcel produced is the one that was on my van. I called a policeman.

Cross-examined by Prisoner. You were running, not walking; we ran into each other just as you got into Watling Street. You did not say to me, ""I know nothing about this parcel, I will come back to a policeman with you ""; all you said was, ""You have got your parcel.""

WILLIAM FAREBROTHER , City Police, 147. Prisoner was given into my custody by last witness. Prisoner said to Walkham, ""You have made a mistake this time, boy."" Walkham said, ""No, I saw you take the parcel from the van."" I tasked prisoner if that was right; he said, ""No, he did not see me take the parcel."" In reply to the charge at the station, prisoner said, ""If is all a mistake.""

ALBERT HALL , salesman, London Shoe Company, identified parcel as one entrusted to the Midland Railway Company for delivery by his firm; value of the goods, £5 14s.

WALKHAM, recalled. To the Jury. I saw the face of the man who was running away with the parcel; he was the prisoner.

To Prisoner. I was looking into the van. I saw you take the parcel from the tail-board. I saw you as I turned round after the rustling.

PRISONER. It is all a mistake.

Verdict, Not guilty."
Royal Offences,"BENJAMIN PEARCE . I am a fishmonger of 108, Mare Street, Hackney. On Saturday night, May 12, at half past 10 prisoner came into my shop and asked for a penny piece of fish and a halfpenny worth of potatoes. I served him. He put a 2s. piece on the counter. Coin produced it the one. It was a bad one. I asked where he got it, and he said his wife had given it to him. I asked him for his name and address; he did not answer. I then fetched a policeman. Prisoner sat and ate his fish and potatoes. I handed constable the bad coin. I told prisoner before I went that I was going to fetch a policeman, and he remained in the shop eating his fish and potatoes.

To the Prisoner. You did have time to answer me before I went to fetch a policeman. You could not have left the shop when I went out because there is a gate against the door, and we could have shut the door instantly on you.

HARRY HOARE , police constable, 206 J Division. I went to Pearce's shop and saw prisoner there. Pearce handed me a bad 2s. piece, and said prisoner had given it to him in payment for some fish. Prisoner admitted that. I asked him how it came into his possession. He said he did not know. I asked him if he had any more money with him. He said, ""Only another half-crown."" I said, ""Let me have a look at it."" He then put his hand in his left-hand trousers pocket and took out a two-shilling piece and a shilling, which he quickly replaced and took out half a crown from his right-hand pocket. I said, ""Let me look at what is in the other pocket."" He took the money out, and I said, ""This two-shilling piece is bad as well."" He said, ""That is the two-shilling piece I gave Mr. Pearce."" I said, ""No, it is not; I have the one you gave him."" I then took him to the station.

PERCY SAUNDERS , police-constable, J Division. I searched prisoner when he was brought into the station. I found half a crown and one shilling good silver and 1/2 d. in bronze, two boxes matches, one packet of ""Woodbine"" cigarettes, three books of cigarette papers, a pocket-book, and a photo.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , Inspector of Counterfeit Coins to His Majesty's Mint. The two florins produced are counter

feit, from the same mould; they are not particularly good imitations.

PRISONER (not on oath). I have never been locked up before; I have never been in trouble in my life before.

Verdict, Guilty. Sentence, Four months' hard labour."
Theft,"HARRIS, Thomas (22, stoker) , burglary in the dwelling-house of William Moore, and stealing therein a saw and other tools, and feloniously receiving same.

WILLIAM MOORE , 42, Dalston Lane, laundryman. On July 3 I locked up my place and went to bed. Early next morning I was aroused by a constable, and found a burglary had been committed; the back door had been burst open. The tools (produced) had been taken. The constable had got the prisoner, and I went to the station and charged him.

JOSEPH TASKER , police-constable, J Division. On July 4, in the early morning, I was on duty in Woodland Street, Dalston, which is at back of Moore's premises. I saw prisoner put his head over the wall from Moore's premises. In a few minutes prisoner came over the wall. I asked him what he had been doing; he said, looking for old iron. He had a saw sticking out of his coat pocket. I said he must come to the station. I aroused Moore, and found that a burglary had been committed at his place. He came to the station and charged prisoner; the tools produced were found in prisoner's pockets. On examining prosecutor's premises I found that a pane of glass

had been broken, and entry had been gained by forcing the back door.

Prisoner. I found the things outside the gate.

Verdict, Guilty. Sentence, Nine months' hard labour."
Theft,"PEARMAN, George (32, labourer), and STONE (29. labourer), pleaded guilty to burglary in the dwelling-house of William James Uphill, and stealing therein a jug, his goods, and four tablecloths and other articles, the goods of Maria Arrowsmith, and feloniously receiving same; burglary in the dwelling-house of James Neville with intent to steal therein; burglary in the dwelling-house of Frederick Edward Hulmes, and stealing therein six basins and other articles, his goods, and feloniously receiving same; and also confessed to previous convictions.

Mr. Ricardo prosecuted.

The burglary at the residence of Mr. Uphill, 4 Granville Park, Blackheath, took place on July 10. The next burglary was on July 12, the residence of Mr. Neville, being in Kew Gardens Road, which was entered through the kitchen window, and things were packed ready for removal. At the next house prisoners were caught. When arrested Stone was wearing a white shirt, part of the proceeds of the burglary at Blackheath. The evidence of police officers showed both prisoners to be habitual criminals.

Sentence, Seven years' penal servitude.

order for the restitution of the goods was made.

Mr. Ricardo said it had been suggested that he should draw his lordship's attention to the ingenuity of the police, after having caught the prisoners, in tracing she other burglaries.

The Common Serjeant said he had not learned sufficient of the circumstances of the case to say more than that no doubt the Commissioner of Police would take notice of it."
Theft,"AUBREY CECIL BARTLETT , Wash away, Cornwall. On August 21 I posted a registered letter addressed to ""Mr. C. Herring,75, High Street, North Finchley, London, N.,"" obtaining the receipt produced; the letter contained a bill and £2 17s. in coin.

JOHN LUKE , sub-postmaster at Washaway. I remember receiving the letter from Bartlett and despatching it to London with another registered letter.

WILLIAM HENRY BOTTOMLBY , sorter, Northern District Post Office, London. I was on duty on the morning of August 22, and received some registered letters from the Great Western Railway travelling post-office. I made out a list for the North Finchley Post Office; it included one addressed to Mr. Herring; this letter I put in the bag for North Finchley.

WILLIAM WARNE . I am in charge of the North Finchley Post Office. I know prisoner; he is an office-cleaner, and does a little work in delivering and collecting letters when we are short. His wages were 7s. 6d. a week as cleaner, with extra money for other work. He came on duty about 6.30 a.m. on August 22. Among the registered letters for delivery that morning was one addressed to Mr. Herring. An entry of this was made in the book produced, and the letter was handed to prisoner for delivery, he signing the ""tab,"" or receipt. The tabs are placed on a file; I have searched the file for this tab, and it is missing. On the postman delivering the letter he should obtain from the recipient a receipt, and this he should place in a little cage at the office. On the morning of the 23rd. when I went to make out my list of receipts, there was no receipt in the cage for this letter. I asked prisoner for the receipt; he said he left it at home in his waistcoat pocket. I told him he must go home and fetch it. He went away, and on his return he said, ""I did not have the registered letter."" I said, ""Yes, you did."" He said, ""Well, where is my receipt

for it.' I then made a thorough search, and, not finding the receipt, and the tab and the office list of registered letters being also missing, I reported the matter to the Northern District Office. Prisoner, in his cleaning duties, would have access to the papers that have been lost. I am positive prisoner is the man to whom I handed the letter and who, signed the tab for it.

GEORGE EDWARD HEAD , postman. I was in the North Finchley Port. Office on the morning of August 23. I heard Warne say to prisoner, ""I want a registered receipt from you,"" and prisoner replied, ""I have left it at home."" Warne told him to go home and fetch it.

CHARLES HERRIG , seedsman, 75, High Street, North Finchley. I never received the £2 17s. which Mr. Bartlett deposes to haying sent to me in a registered letter.

FRANCIS M. HILL , clerk in Secretary's Office, G.P.O. On August 24 I saw prisoner at the North Finchley office and asked him to come the next day to the G.P.O. He did not come, and on August 28 I sent Police-constable Downs to find him, and he was arrested. Prisoner's weekly earnings have averaged the last six months £1 1s. 6d. He is a single man; he has been in post-office employ since November last.

ARTHUR Downs, a Metropolitan Police officer, on special duty at the G.P.O. On August 28 I took prisoner into custody on the charge of stealing the registered letter described. He made no reply to the charge. Before the magistrate he said, ""All I can say is that I am not guilty; I have no witnesses to call.""

(Wednesday, September 12.)

(Defence.)

JAMES ROBERT LONG (prisoner, on oath). I am engaged as cleaner, and occasionally as sorter and postman by the General Post Office. I wish to say that I am innocent of the charge brought against me, that I neither received the letter nor did I sign the tab, nor did I receive the registered letter from Mr. Warne. I had some conversation with Mr. Warne about the letter on the morning of August 23. At seven o'clock he came to me and asked me if I had a receipt from Mr. Herring. I told him I had not and had never had a registered letter for Mr. Herring. Mr. Warne said, in reply, ""Yet, you did; think."" I told him I never had it. Again at nine o'clock he asked me if I had a receipt from Mr. Herring. I told him I had never had one. When I told Mr. Warne the receipt was at home in my waistcoat pocket I thought he meant the receipt for a registered parcel I had the day beforehand. At eleven o'clock he asked me again for the receipt, and I went home to

look for it. I found it, and left it in the office; I put it in the box. he parcel was directed to Holmwood School, Wood side. he first and last delivery to Mr. Herrings would b, carried out by me. I do not Know anything about the missing tab and list.

Cross-examined. I had the insured parcel for delivery at night time on the 21st, which was a Tuesday. I did not deliver ii that night, as I got no answer. I took ii home ""s the office was closed. For the same reason I could not deliver it next morning, and I brought it back to the office. I did not make a third attempt to deliver it, and as a matter of fact I never delivered that parcel at an. On the 22nd I handed the parcel over to Mr. Warne. I afterwards handed back the unsigned receipt. I thought that was the receipt Mr. Warne meant, as he did not ask me for Mr. Herring's receipt but for a receipt. The parcel was afterwards delivered by a postman, who must have had the receipt with it. That was the only receipt I ever had.

WILLIAM WARNE , recalled, said he did not recollect giving prisoner an insured parcel on the 21st. Another man was in charge of the insured parcel, which was brought back the next morning, prisoner stating that he could get no answer at the address. The receipt was handed over with the parcel. The parcel was handed over to the next man in charge. It was delivered later in the day, and the receipt produced in the usual way.

Verdict, Guilty. Sentence, Nine months' hard labour."
Breaking Peace,"Mr. Muir and Mr. Kershaw prosecuted; Mr. Coumbe defended.

Police-constable CHARLES PELL , 266 C. On the morning of November 19 last I made a plan of the scene of the accident. The motor bus was still in Park Lane, opposite Dudley House. The railings between Hyde Park and Park Lane were broken down to the extent of about 11 ft. 6 in. I could not say what damage the motor-bus had sustained as I did not examine it. The front of the motor-bus was right up against the coping of the railings. The width of the road there is 41 ft.

JOHN WILLIAM DOVE , four-wheeled cab-driver, badge number 14941. On the night of November 18 I was driving my cab along Park Lane empty, going home, on my near side. I do not remember anything about the accident until I found myself in St. George's Hospital.

Cross-examined. I cannot even remember that the motor-'bus struck me. My horse was a very quiet one. I shall not get another one like it in a hurry. I have not yet brought an action against the motor-'bus company for damages, but they have been to see me.

HENRY WILLIAMS . I live at 36, Lyncroft Gardens, Finohley Road, N. I am of independent means. On the night of November 18 I got O. on this Vanguard motor-'bus (which was driven by the prisoner) P. close by Victoria Station, with the intention of going to Marble Arch. Q. I was sitting inside on the nearest seat to the driver on the left-hand R. side immediately opposite to him, and could see everything clearly. S. I noticed with regard to his driving that he took the corners that we T. passed at the same speed as when going straight, which was too fast.

When the motor-'bus got into Park Lane I noticed that the accused, instead of keeping on the near side of the rests, after passing one rest, got in between that and the next that he was approaching; he drove as near as he could safely do to the next rest and then came out on the near side again, coming past the rest he was immediately meeting with only a few inches to spare. (To the Judge.) He was keeping what was described in the police court as a ""serpentine"" course. (To Mr. Kershaw.) He was not driving faster than motor-'buses usually are driven. We passed several horse-drawn vehicles. I saw the four-wheeled cab. When I first saw the cab it was being driven along in the same direction as the motor-'bus was going. Immediately before we got to it, the driving of the accused was what I should describe as ""monkey tricks""—he was apparently trying his best to pass the cab in the same kind of way that he had been previously driving. Immediately before striking the cab I think the cab horse took a step to the right, but it was only then a question of inches. There is a slight turn in the road there, and the cab was on its proper side. As far as I can say the body of the motor-'bus caught the box of the off-hind wheel of the cab. I think the accused in his excitement, instead of putting off power, accelerated the speed. I thought to myself, ""Am I going to be killed?"" and I flung myself on the bottom of the 'bus, which went into the Hyde Park railings like greased lightning. This stopped the 'bus. The glass of the motor-'bus was smashed. I suggested that the cab horse should be shot; I believe it eventually was killed, though I did not see it. When I got out of the 'bus I saw the accused, who spoke to me, and I said, ""Please do not speak to me; you drove like a damned lunatic."" I saw the police put the cabman in another four-wheeled cab and send him off to the hospital. This was about 20 minutes after. The accused at that time had not been taken to the station.

Cross-examined. The steering gear of the motor-'bus and the cab may have been closely locked. The accused took the corners in a reckless fashion. I have very rarely been up and down the route at all. I cannot say whether there is a sweep of the road as it comes by St. George's Hospital. There are several rests in Park Lane. I am absolutely certain he drove as I have said. It was not a greasy night but there had been plenty of wet on the roads. I thought it was a most scandalous way of driving. I had been spending the evening with my sister and some nephews, with whom I had had tea.

Re-examined. He appeared to be driving as near the cab as possible. We passed a couple of hansom cabs, and, I think, one or two other horse-drawn vehicles; there was lots of room. (To the Judge.) Although I have come to give evidence against the accused, I have had a great deal of experience of motor traffic, by cycling and seeing it where I live; and I know these drivers have precious little time to themselves. No sooner is a 'bus up, than it is off again, and if this poor fellow had been drinking a little, I could excuse him myself. I hope, if he is found guilty, you will be lenient with him.

Mr. Kershaw stated that whatever the result of the case might be he felt that everybody was much indebted to the witness coming forward to give evidence, with which the Judge concurred.

Police-constable CHARLES GREEN , 392 C. About half-past 11 on November 18, I was on special duty at Dudley House, in Park Lane. I heard the crash and saw the motor-'bus on the left hand side of the road; it was then on the pavement, the front of the 'bus touching toe railings, about 12 of which were broken. The cab was also on the footway a little south of the motor-'bus. The horse's head was lying on the coping stone of the railings, its front legs were under the wheels of the 'bus, and the other part of it was on the footway. I saw the driver lying on his back in a southerly direction. The motor-'bus must have passed 10 yards at least from where he fell off. I saw the prisoner there and by this time there were a number of other people. Police-constable Thorn came up, and I sent him off with the injured cabman to the hospital. I also sent for a ""vet.,"" and the horse was slaughtered. I said to the prisoner, ""How do you account for this? Where is your license?"" He produced his license and said, ""The driver pulled to the right into me, and struck my steering wheel, rendering it powerless."" While I was speaking to him I noticed his condition—he was drunk. He smelt very strongly of drink; he was unsteady in his gait; and while I was taking particulars of his license, he kept pushing up against me. I sent him later to Marlborough Street Police Station in custody of Police-constable Marony—I should think about 12 o'clock. Marlborough Street Police Station is about 20 minutes or half an hour's walk from Park Lane.

Cross-examined. I did not send him off to the station until about half an hour after the accident. In my opinion he was drunk—I do not mean that he was incapable; his breath smelt very strong. His speech was thick. I cannot say that I have ever been in a fright myself, but I have seen people who have been very frightened indeed and have not thought that they were drunk. Those people have been able to talk quite clearly and distinctly at times, and at times not.

Police-sergeant ALBERT TIMMS , 23 C. I went to the scene of the occurrence on the night of November 18. Police-constable Green was there before me. When I got there I saw the motor-'bus and the horse and the cab. I sent for a ""vet."" and the horse was slaughtered. I did not speak to the prisoner until after this, which would be 20 to 25 minutes after I got there. I asked him how it occurred and he explained to me that his steering wheel caught the hind wheel of the cab. I made a note at the time which says, ""I saw the driver and asked him how it occurred, and he said, 'I was coming up the Lane when I thought I had got room to pass the cab. My steering wheel might have hit this cab and I could not help myself.'"" After I had spoken to him I came to the conclusion that he was drunk. I judged this by his manner of speech, and he reeled up towards me; he was

thick in his speech, and his face was very flushed. I sent him with Police-constable Marony to Marlborough Street Police Station. The conversation I had with the prisoner was quite independent of that which Police-constable Green had with him.

Cross-examined. When I spoke to prisoner it would be about 40 minutes after the accident. There is not, to my knowledge, a public-house quite near the scene of the accident—the nearest one would be in Park Street. I did not know at the time I spoke to the prisoner that he had gone to the nearest public-house and had a drink. I do not think there was time. I saw him several times without speaking to him. During the time I was taking particulars of the accident he did not go away to my knowledge. He may have received a shock, but I do not think if would bring him in the state in which he was.

Re-examined. While I was there I am quite sure the accused did not go into a public-house. I was not asked any question about this at the police-court.

Police-constable GREEN , recalled. There were a number of people collected on the spot, and a number of constables came up. The nearest public-house is some distance from the scene of the accident. I should think 500 or 600 yards; 440 yard is a quarter of a mile; probably the public-house was not quite so far away as that—it is the length of a street—it is some distance. It would take the accused some noticeable time to go there and get a drink. and come back again to the scene of the accident. I was not keeping any particular observation on him during this time. I know the route of the motor-'bus. Some 'buses take a diagonal sweep from the Triumphal Arch to Hamilton Place; others do not.

Police-constable HENRY MARONY , 171 C. I was on duty at half-past 11 on November 18, and was sent by Sergeant Times with the prisoner to Marlborough Street Police Station. I started with the prisoner about 20 minutes past 12. The Marlborough Street Police Station was about 20 minutes' to half an hour's walk. Prisoner was very excited and he smelt very strongly of drink, but he walked all right. In my opinion he was drunk.

Cross-examined. I have been five years in the force. I have had some experience of 'busmen and cabmen, and rows and accidents, I should not, because I heard a row, say that a man was drunk. He smelt strongly of drink and was very excited; I do not think he was frightened.

Inspector JOHN RENFRAY , C Division. I was on duty at Marlborough Street Police Station in the early morning of November 19, when the prisoner was brought in at 12.40. In my opinion he was drunk—unfit to drive. He smelt very strongly of drink—he had a flushed appearance and a generally ""muddled"" appearance. I did not say anything to him at that time with reference to drink. The divisional surgeon, Dr. Edmunds, examined him. I told Dr. Edmunds that the prisoner was charged with being drunk in charge of a motor-omnibus.

It was 1.30 when the charge was read to him. After the charge had been read he said he had not seen the doctor. I then read, from the doctor's book at the station, the doctor's certificate that he was drunk and not fit to drive. The prisoner still denied being drunk.

Cross-examined. I took into consideration the fact that the man had had a bad accident; I think that would have a sobering effect rather than anything else. I did not put him to any tests. I had formed my opinion of him before I saw the doctor. The constables came and told me what happened, and I had to go on that as to whether it was a case to go before the magistrate. Mr. Montgomery (a member of the London County Council) came to the station, and expressed surprise on hearing that the accused was charged with being drunk.

DR. PERCY EDMUNDS . I am divisional surgeon at Great Marlborough Street Police Station. On the night of the 18th and the early morning of November 19 I was asked to examine the defendant, and I did so. He most fully understood that I was the doctor. After I had examined him, and told him I thought he was drunk, he asked me to put him to further tests. When I examined him I asked him first of all to show me his tongue. It was very dirty and quite dry; his lips were also quite dry. I then examined his eyes with a lenses and I found the pupils rather dilated, and they did not respond quickly, as the pupils should do when a beam of light is thrown in. His breach smelt very rankly. It was a stale smell, as if he had been drinking half the day. I could smell it at a distance off—4 ft. or 5 ft. off. He spoke very well; his articulation was not affected arterially at all. He walked fairly well, considering that he had heavy trousers on, such as motor-drivers wear. I gave him credit for walking and good enunciation. I told him I considered he had had a great deal too much to drink, and was not under control. He said, ""This is a very important matter for me, doctor; I want you to put me to other tests."" He said he would like to write his name, and I handed him that piece of paper marked ""A"" that I had been making some notes upon. He came up to the desk, and wrote his signature, ""Richard Sansom."" I said, ""Well, that is not bad, but the 'Richard' is rather weak."" He said, ""Let me write it again,"" and he did so. Taking everything into account I considered it then my duty to say that he was drunk—that he was not fit to drive a motor-car.

Cross-examined. The effect of coming out from the dark into a lighted room would make the pupils contract. His eyes were a little too open. I do not know of any sudden action, by fright, upon the pupils. The defendant showed no symptoms of fear. I think Darwin's ""Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals"" was written 25 to 30 years ago. People have learned a great deal more shout the nervous system since then. I paid a great deal of attention to the defendant's case, and endeavoured to treat him with every fairness. It was not brought to my knowledge that between the time of the

accident and when brought to the police station he had had one glass of bitter ale. I have been 13 years at Vine Street and Marlborough Street Stations. I don't think, from the fact of having had to deal previously with a lot of ""drunks and disorderliness,"" that I came to a wrong conclusion with regard to this man.

Re-examined. It would not be possible for him to be in the state he was in if he had only one glass of beer in the morning and one after the accident.

(Thursday, December 12.)

JAMES ARTHUR VENNING . I was house surgeon at St. George's Hospital, on November 18 last, when the cabman was brought into the hospital at about midnight. He remained under my charge until he left the hospital on December 4. When brought in he was conscious, but suffering from concussion of the brain. There was no external symptom; his recovery was slow. I saw him yesterday, but not to examine him. It is impossible to say how long it will be before he can resume work. I said at the police court that I thought two months at least. From seeing him yesterday it is still more impossible to say.

(Defence.)

RICHARD SANSOM (prisoner, on oath). I have been a motor-'bus driver for 11 months, in the employ of the Vanguard Motor-'Bus Company; previously I was in the employ of the London United Tramway Company, for five years as conductor. I have a clean license. On the morning of the day of the accident I started from home after a fair breakfast. I took the motor-'bus out of the garage, and at 11 o'clock something went wrong with it. I put it right, and went on again to Willesden, when the 'bus broke down altogether. I could not rectify it, and the conductor telephoned to the road-fitter, who arrived at six o'clock in the evening. The motor-'bus was got to go again at 9.55 that evening. We loft the ""White Horse,"" Willesden, and got to Ebury Bridge just about 11 o'clock. Inspector Ellis is time-keeper there. The conductor's name is Henry Jeffries. The fitters name is Haddow. I had a glass of beer at 11 o'clock in the morning; one glass at 1 o'clock with some bread and cheese, and I had had one more drink in the course of the afternoon before the road-fitter came at six o'clock. I did not have any drink after that. From Ebury Bridge to the place of the accident I have seen the road worse, but it was bad. On the route there is only one corner that can properly be described as a ""corner""—Hamilton Place. The motor-'bus went slantingly across the road from Grosvenor Place to Hamilton Place, because there was little traffic. It bad been raining a considerable part of the day, but it was not raining at the time; although it was muddy it was drying. In Hamilton Place the condition of the road was rather bad. There was mud towards the side of the road where the road sloped down; the middle of the road was pretty good travelling. In Park Lane there are several

rests, some of which I was obliged to pass before the accident happened. I kept the middle of the road as much as I possibly could. I had to go a little to the side when I came to a rest, and after I had pared the rest I went round into the middle of the road again, to as to have the beet part of the road to drive on. There is no truth in the suggestion that I followed a ""serpentine"" course or was up to ""monkey tricks."" I was driving carefully from eight to 10 miles an hour where the road was good. The distance from the Victoria Station to the scene of the accident is perhaps a mile and a half. The accident took place just after 11.25, but before 11.30. What took place immediately before the scene of the accident was this: I came to this four-wheeled cab; it was not exactly in the kerb, it was more towards the crown of the road and I attempted to panama him. I had to get a little nearer him than I was in the first place, but I allowed myself sufficient room to pass him, and certainly there were more than inches between me and the cab. I had to keep a little closer in on account of a nasty turning I was coming to. At that time of night there are a good many hansom cabs and motor-cabs taking theatre parties home which come across from Upper Brook Street at rather a swing round the corner. I could not get too far on the right-hand side of the road in case of an accident in those cases. I was just passing the four-wheeled cab—I passed his back wheel—and suddenly I saw his horse pull out—whether the horse was frightened or not I do not know. I pulled my 'bus out, but I pulled my wheel rather too violently having regard to the bad state of the road—the road sloping down a good deal towards the gutter—with the result that my front wheels skidded into him and my near front wheel caught his off-front wheel. The collision quite took the steering out of my hand, and the 'bus, in skidding as it went down, rather gained force than anything else by the skid, the state of the road being what it was; and being still looked with the four-wheeled cab we both went on to the pavement. Directly afterwards I got down to see what assistance I could give, and I found my conductor had tacked up the cabman, who was afterwards taken to the hospital. After that I went round trying to interview people I thought were passengers. Mr. Williams got out of the 'bus first and he spoke to me, and also Mr. Montgomery and also Mr. Deverell. I felt rather shaken up and very much distressed on account of the serious accident, and walked down the mews and went across to a public-house in Park Street and asked for a drop of brandy. I put threepence in coppers on the counter and the barmaid served me with ""mild and bitter""—I did not know whether it was only a beer-house or not. I drank the ""mild and bitter,"" and the girl looked at the coppers and wondered I suppose why I put threepence down, and I had another glass. I was not gone more than 10 minutes. I went back again, and the police-sergeant being there wanted more particulars; he sent me with a constable to the station. I was charged with being drunk, and I said it was ridiculous. I asked to see the doctor and saw him. He examined me and I asked to be put to further tests. The doctor told me to

write my name down, which I did. The inspector said that I said I had not ""seen"" the doctor. What I said was I had not ""finished"" with the doctor.

Cross-examined. This was last journey home that night. At 11 'clock in the morning the motor-'bus broke down near the Falcon Hotel, West Kilburn. I did not have to get assistance on that occasion. I had one drink at the Falcon Hotel. It broke down again at one o'clock and did not star: again until 9.55. I had nothing to eat at all after breakfast except some bread and cheese at one o'clock. I recognise the plan. I did not mention the skidding to Police-constable Green. I did not ever in any way suggest to Sergeant Timing that the accident was caused by skidding. To my mind skidding was not the principal cause of the accident—it was that the cab pulled out of its proper course. If I had not skidded possibly I should have cleared the cab. It did not strike me at the time as being important to mention it to the police-constable. I thought Sergeant Timms would have gone and seen for himself the marks of the skidding. I cannot say why he did not see them; they certainly must have been there. I was very much upset; I was suffering from a good deal of feeling.

Re-examined. I was not asked by either of the police officers about skidding. There is no truth in the suggestion that I was guilty of wilful and wanton driving, or that I was drunk.

HENRY EDWARD JEFFRIES , conductor of the motor-'bus, corroborated the last witness as to the times the 'bus was running. Just before the accident I noticed the cab immediately in front. Noticing the bus slightly swerve I thought there was a passenger to pick up. Whether the cab horse was startled or the driver pulled him I could not say. The front wheel of the 'bus seemed to skid into the cab and the two vehicles ran into the railings. The driver was not either reckless or drunk.

Cross-examined. The first time when the 'bus broke down, near the Falcon Hotel, the accused did not go and have a drink while I was there. If he says he did I never missed him. I never missed him between three o'clock and 9.55. At seven o'clock I loft the 'bus and went to a coffee shop to get some tea. The fitter was working at the car about six o'clock and Sansom was assisting him, and if he went away then I should have undoubtedly missed him.

Re-examined. I could not say the exact time as I had no watch. All I can say is I did not miss him.

PETER HADDOW , fitter Vanguard Motor Omnibus Company. I got to Church Road. Willesden, at six o'clock on the day in question, and the accused stayed and held a light for me while I was repairing the 'bus He was perfectly sober the whole of the time.

Cross-examined. He was holding the light for me.

GEORGE ELLIS , inspector and timekeeper, Vanguard Motor Omnibus Company. I was on duty at Ebury Bridge at 11 o'clock on the night of the accident. The accused, before leaving Victoria, had to go down a decline, and circle round, and come up the hill again, and

turn to his right, and to his right again. That requires a driver who is perfect in his work. The accused was as sober at I am now. I booked him of! at 11.6.

Cross-examined. The drivers know I am on duly there; I book the 'buses away. The driver got off and stood on the pavement; I Spoke to him for a few minutes.

ROBERT HUGH MONTGOMERY . I am a member of the London County Council. On the night of the accident I was in Park Lane. I saw there had been an accident, and made inquiries as to what had happened. The accused came up to me and said, ""Did you see the accident?"" I said I did not I asked him how it had occurred, and he told me that a a he was passing the four-wheeler it pulled out and hit his steering wheel and he lost control. He said a few other words, but I do not recollect what they were. I was very much interested in the horse, which was in great pain and was afterwards slaughtered. After that I saw the prisoner being taken off, and I went to the police-station and expressed my opinion to the inspector. During my conversation with the accused he struck me as being absolutely sober. I should have been quite content he should have driven one of my cars. I have attended here at great personal inconvenience.

Cross-examined. I did not see anything at all of the driving of the motor 'bus. I was given to understand that the accident occurred eight or 10 minutes before I arrived on the scene. From the conversion I had with the accused I formed the opinion that he was sober. I went to the police court, but I was not called—nobody was called.

FRANCIS DEVERELL . I am a mining engineer, living at 17, Bryanston Street. I was in Park Lane on the night of the accident about two minutes after it occurred. I asked the driver how the accident happened, and he gave me his version of it. I noticed that he appeared to me to be in every way absolutely coherent, and he did not seem to have had anything at all in the way of drink. I have a very keen sense of smell, and I think I should have noticed it if he had been drinking. I attended at the police court, but I was not called as the defence was reserved. I have attended here at great personal inconvenience.

Cross-examined. I did not notice any smell of drink at all. The prisoner seemed to me to be exactly in the same state that he has been on other occasions in which I have met him in Court, except that he was much upset at what had happened. I should say he appeared aggrieved rather. I have a very keen sense of smell myself, being practically a teetotaller. I understood from the accused that the cabman pulled across in front of his wheels as he was going by and the vehicles in acme way got locked together.

Mrs. ELIZABETH KIRTON . I live at 14, Barnsdale Road, Maida Vale. I was a passenger in the motor 'bus on the night of the accident. I should say the pace was moderate. If he had been driving furiously I should have been too nervous to stay in it. After the accident the driver said, ""This is rather a serious accident. I hope nobody

blames me, as my steering gear got looked."" He was decidedly not drunk.

Cross-examined. I got on the bus at Victoria Station; there were five other passengers in it besides myself. I was sitting on the first seat inside on the right hand side. I did not see anything of the four-wheeler before the accident—I only heard the crash of the glass.

WALTER HENRY PLOWMAN . I live at 102, Disraeli Road, Putney. I am an inspector in the employ of the Vanguard Motor 'Bus Company. I was checking another 'bus coming from the Marble Arch to Park Lane. My attention was called to the accident. I saw the driver of the four-wheeled cab picked up by the conductor and taken on to the pavement and then sent away in a cab. I had a conversation with the driver, and he told me how it occurred. I also smelt his breath in the company's interests to see what his condition was. If I had found him drunk and incapable or found anything improper in his driving it would have been my duty to have sent to the yard for them to take the 'bus away. I formed the opinion that he was absolutely sober. (To the Judge.) When I smelt his breath I smelt nothing in the shape of drink.

Cross-examined. I should say it was five minutes after the accident happened that I smelt his breath. I was not at the police court I do not know Dr. Edmunds. If be has said that the driver's breath when he examined him at 20 minutes past one was very offensive and smelt of drink, I should be very much surprised. That would not alter my opinion at all. It is a serious thing for the company if a driver is the worse for drink.

Re-examined. I do not know how it would affect the company in this trial, which is a criminal one.

Verdict, Not guilty of being drunk. On the second count, the Jury said there was not proper care used in driving and added that they thought the 'bus itself was not in a proper condition to be let out.

The Judge suggested to accused whether it might not be wise for him to put himself for the future in such a position that, if any accident ever occurred again, he would be in a very strong position with regard to his condition. He was released on his own recognisances in £10 to come up for judgment if called on.

BEFORE MR. JUSTICE GRANTHAM.

(Thursday, December 12.)"
Theft,"WILLIAM ARCHER , detective in the employ of the Great Northern Railway Company. On December 24. about 9.50 p.m., I was on duty at King's Cross Station when I saw the prisoner with another man. There were a lot of trucks loaded with parcels. I saw prisoner go towards the trucks, then I missed him for a short time, and afterwards saw him coming down No. 1 platform with a bale on his shoulder. I and another officer followed him out of the station to the top of Euston Road, and there we stopped him. I said, ""Where did you get that from?"" He said, ""Another man gave it to me to carry."" I said, ""Who?"" He made no reply. I said, ""We are police officers, and shall take you into custody."" I took him to the Great Northern Police Office and examined the bale. I found that it was a bale containing cloth for Bradford. He refused to give any name or address. He was the a handed over to a Metropolitan policeman. (To Judge Lumley Smith.) The parcels were loaded on hand-trucks or

trolleys. Prisoner was merely going up to where all the hand-trucks were assembled, I did not see him going to any particular truck. It was about a minute and a half afterwards when I saw him carrying the bale. I did not see him take it off the hand-truck. The ticket showed that it had been put in at the Old Street Receiving Office and sent up to King's Cross.

Cross-examined. Prisoner had carried the parcel about 300 yards when I arrested him. There was no other man there. There was another man when I saw him going towards the luggage, but I did not see that other man again.

Detective PENNY , Great Northern Railway Company. I was with the last witness, and saw and heard the same as he. Prisoner is not in the employment of the company. When I first saw him going towards the trucks there was another man with him. They were both str✗gers to me. I did not see the other man again.

JOHN URE , packer in the employ of Messrs. Peerless and Sons, 61, Old Street, cloth merchants. On December 24 I packed up some cloth in a bale. I saw the bale and contents at the police-court. By the direction of the magistrate the wrapper was taken off and the goods were forwarded. I identify the wrapper produced.

FREDERICK WILLIAM DOUGHTON , parcel porter at the Old Street Receiving Office of the Great Northern Railway Company. On December 24 I received a bale to be forwarded to Bradford. I produce the book in which it was entered. The bale was forwarded to King's cross.

HENRY PELLING , clerk at King's Cross Station, Great Northern Railway Company. On December 24 I received a bale with the wrapping produced. The bale was booked and put upon the platform to be despatched to Bradford.

Police-constable FRANK WOODLAND , 578 Y. On December 24 I was called to the police office of the Great Northern Railway Company, where prisoner was detained, and he was given into my custody. He made no answer to the charge.

Verdict, Guilty.

Sergeant GOODCHILD, Y Division, proved several previous convictions.

Sentence: 18 months' hard labour."
Killing,"Police-constable WILLIAM WATERMAN, V Division. I produce a plan of the place where the occurrence took place, drawn according, to scale.

PHYLLIS MARY MCEWEN , 34, Red Lion Street, Richmond, daughter of deceased. On Sunday, December 15, I returned from Sunday School between 4.30 and 4.35. As I went in my father came out to tell the boys to leave off shouting round his door. There were a lot of boys. It had happened before. He went straight up to the boys in the direction of the ""Forge,"" and I followed him. Prisoner asked my father if he wanted to buy a yellow guinea-pig or a green crow. My father said he did not want anything to do with him. Tomasso said something to my father which I did pot hear, and then he gave my father a blow on the chest, and my father fell down near the fence. Then he got up again and went into the road. He went like this (turning one hand over the other), but never doubled his fists. I think he tried to defend himself. Then prisoner gave him another blow in the side after my father rushed at him. My father fell about on the kerb, and I ran home and told my mother.

Cross-examined. When I followed my father out of the house, Tomasso was standing by himself. My father was known as ""Slasher McCan."" I do not know why. When the boys annoyed him he used to follow them into the street. I do not know that he threw stones at them or thrashed them. He used to chase them with a stick occasionally.

I did not hear my father say to Tomasso, ""Why do you not prevent the boys throwing stones at my door?"" nor did I hear Tomasso say, ""I did not do it, and I cannot prevent them doing it."" While my father was talking to Tomasso a crowd of boys and girls came up. I saw Ethel Garrard there. I did not see someone push her towards my father and Tomasso. I heard somebody shout, ""Go it, Slasher."" That was before Tomasso struck my father. I did not hear my father call Tomasso an ignorant pig. When the struggle commenced Tomasso was making fun of my father. My father seemed angry. Tomasso was not angry. I did not see my father strike Tomasso. He did not strike a blow at all that I saw. Only two blows were struck. I have described the first blow as a push. He was pushing my father away. Then on the second occasion my father rushed at Tomasso, who was in the middle of the street. The whole affair lasted about three minutes.

FREDERICK COLLIER , 1, Lower Mortlake Road, farrier's improver. On December 15 about 4.40 I was in Red Lion Street talking to Ethel Garrard and the prisoner. We were opposite the ""Forge."" I heard some boys calling out, ""Slasher McCan."" I saw McEwen, who was telling the boys they ought to know better. Prisoner hid behind a girl, after tapping McEwen on the left shoulder for fun. The boys used to annoy him every Sunday. Then prisoner made a rude noise with his mouth and hollered out, ""Slasher!"" McEwan said, ""You are not a man. You have not the breath of a man in you. You are an ignorant pig."" Prisoner said, ""I will put you over the fence."" McEwen said, ""It will take a dozen like you,"" or something like that. Prisoner said, ""I have ate six men like you before breakfast,"" and put himself in a fighting position. When McEwen saw that, he Went like this (turning one hand over the other). I should not call that a fighting position. Prisoner hit him, and he fell against the fence. He hit with his fist, I think. McEwen got up again almost immediately and stepped from where he had fallen, and then prisoner hit him again, and he fell. McEwen had not done anything to prisoner. I did not see him hit him. The prisoner's blow fell on McEwen's stomach, and he fell like a log on his face and he did not speak again. I helped to take McEwen into his house.

Cross-examined. I did not hear McEwen ask prisoner to stop the boys from throwing stones at his door. I do not know that McEwen ever caught the boys and punished them. I could not say when prisoner became angry. He struck the first blow in anger. After McEwen called prisoner a pig he did not strike him.

Re-examined. I did not see McEwen hit prisoner. If he had done so I should have seen it.

ALBERT BAKER , 6, Sheen Vale, Richmond, golf caddie. At about 4.45 p.m. on December 15 I was in Red Lion Street, and saw a crowd outside the ""Forge."" I saw prisoner hit McEwen and knock him against the fence. McEwen got up and walked into the road. He had his hands down; he was not in fighting attitude. Prisoner hit him again and knocked him down. McEwen fell flat on his face.

Cross-examined. I came up rather late in the day. I did not see McEwen with his fists closed. I think I said at the coroner's inquest that McEwen was standing with his fists closed.

Re-examined. His fists were down by his side.

ETHEL GARRARD , 9, Long's Cottages, Richmond, domestic servant. On December 15, about 4.45, I was in Red Lion Street with Collier, talking to prisoner. The boys were round about us, and I saw McEwen come towards them. I heard a voice call out, ""Slasher!"" When he came up to the boys he told them to behave themselves. Prisoner tapped McEwen on the shoulder and then hid behind a girl, and made a rude noise with his mouth, and called out ""Slasher."" McEwen turned round and saw who it was, and said, ""Who spoke to you, you ignorant pig. You have not the breath of a man in you."" Prisoner said, ""I will put you over the fence."" McEwen said, ""Would you?"" Prisoner said, ""I have ate half a dozen men like you before breakfast."" McEwen said he was not afraid of anybody of his own stamp. Prisoner then got into a fighting attitude, and McEwen went like this (turning one hand over the other). Then prisoner struck the blow in the chest and McEwen fell against the fence in a sitting position. Then McEwen got up and walked into the road, doing the same thing with his hands. I told prisoner to let him alone, because prisoner was too strong for him. Prisoner gave him another blow and McEwen fell down. Prisoner is in the Militia. I have seen him punch the ball, but I have not seen him box anybody.

Cross-examined. Prisoner ran behind Caroline Sharp's back after tapping McEwen on the shoulder. Prisoner took it as a joke up to a certain point. I heard the boys shout out, ""Go it, Slasher,"" encouraging him to strike prisoner. I did not see McEwen rush at prisoner.

JAMES GREGORY , 3, Wellington Place, Richmond, golf caddie. On December 15, about 4.45, I was near the ""Forge."" I heard prisoner say, ""Death to all the pigs in Ireland."" I suppose McEwen was an Irishman. Then I saw prisoner in a fighting attitude and rush at McEwen and give him a blow with his left fist in the chest, knocking him against the fence. He got up and walked out into the road, where prisoner was. Prisoner struck him again in the stomach, and he fell down on his face. I did not see McEwen hit prisoner at all.

Cross-examined. It was not all over when I came up. I have not talked to Ethel Garrard about this case. It is true that at 4.45 I was in the park, but the park is not near half a mile away from Red Lion Street.

CAROLINE SHARP , 9, Prospect Place, Richmond, domestic servant. On December 15, about 4.45, I was in Red Lion Street and heard the boys calling out ""Slasher."" I turned round and saw McEwen come from his house and ask the boys to leave off calling after him. I saw prisoner pat him on the shoulder and then make a rude noise with his mouth. McEwen asked him to leave off, and prisoner shoved McEwen against the fence. Afterwards prisoner hit him again and

knocked him on the ground. That was after McEwen had rushed towards prisoner, but McEwen never hit him.

Cross-examined. Prisoner did not run behind me. I did not see him run behind anybody. The quarrel arose very suddenly. Before you could turn round they were fighting.

Re-examined. McEwen rusned towards prisoner to hit him, but did not do so, and prisoner hit him a blow which knocked him down. ELIZABETH ANN MCEWEN , 34, Bed Lion Street, widow of deceased. My husband was 46 years of age. He was a gardener. His father was Scotch and his mother was Irish. On December 15 I saw him go out of doors in the afternoon. Soon afterwards he was brought back, and a doctor was sent for and came soon after five o'clock. My husband was not out more than two or three minutes.

Cross-examined. My husband was very excitable at times. The boys used to annoy him, and he used to rush out after them and sometimes throw sticks and stones at them, I believe. He was an apparently strong man. I was told that on one occasion he hit a boy named Hockley over the head with a stick, but I never saw it. He had been abroad, in hot countries. He never complained of pain in his head. I never heard that he had had sunstroke.

HAROLD BAXTER BOULTER , Hill Street, Richmond, medical practitioner. On December 15 I was called to 34, Red Lion Street, about five p.m., and saw McEwen, who was then dead. I found upon the forehead a scalp wound about-an inch long; there was a contused swelling over the right eyebrow, and various scratches and abrasions upon that side of his face and upon his nose and cheek. The next day Dr. Gardner made a post mortem, at which I was present. We formed the opinion that death was caused by an effusion of blood on the brain caused by the rupture of a vessel, which was caused by the blow which he received on his head.

Cross-examined. Excitement will sometimes cause the rupture of a blood-vessel. The scalp wound was not very, severe. The wounds upon the right cheek were more than scratches, but I could not call them severe. The bruise over the right eyebrow may have been due to the fall. The wounds were not such as to cause death.

MATTHEW HENRY GARDNER , medical practitioner. On December 16 1 held a post mortem, with Dr. Boulter, upon McEwen's body. We concluded that death was caused by pressure on the brain from blood which had poured out from a ruptured blood vessel, which rupture was caused by violence. It may have been caused by the blow on the face, or by the force of the fall.

Cross-examined. Excitement will cause the rupture of a blood-came vessel. It is only because I heard that there was violence that I to the conclusion that violence caused the rupture.

Detective-sergeant ALBERT OHATT . About 5.55 on December 15 I went to Red Lion Street, and saw the dead body of McEwen. subsequently went to Hounslow and made inquiries, and at 10.20 I went to 2, Derby Road, Hounslow, where I saw prisoner. In reply to the charge he said, ""He struck me first. I struck him back in selfdefence.""

He did not say anything about a scar upon his face. I took him to Hounslow Police Station, and subsequently to Richmond.

Cross-examined. Constable Taylor was with me when I arrested prisoner. I heard him say something to Taylor. When we got to Hounslow Station I saw a slight scratch under his eye, which looked as if it had been done quite recently.

(Defence.)

Captain HANCOCK , Adjutant. 7th Battalion Royal Fusiliers. Prisoner has been in the battalion from September 1, 1906. During the time he has been soldiering he has had a very good character. He is now lance-sergeant.

GEORGE LONG , 10, Bottom's Place, Richmond. On December 15, about 4.45, I saw McEwen come up to prisoner. He said, ""You are an ignorant pig."" Prisoner put himself in fighting attitude, and McEwen rushed at him and struck him on the face. Prisoner then hit him and knocked him down. McEwen got up and again ran at prisoner, who was standing in the middle of the road. Prisoner knocked him straight down on his face. I am certain that McEwen hit prisoner first.

Cross-examined. I was not called at the police-court nor before the coroner. Mr. Tomasso, prisoner's father, first asked me to give evidence a week ago. He did not give me a penny, nor any money, nor promise me any. I told my mother that he had given me a penny, so that I should not have to give evidence. I did not wish to give evidence because I was afraid of losing my job at the baker's if I came here. I did not tell my mother that the statement I had made to prisoner's solicitor that McEwen had hit prisoner first was false. My mother did not tell me that she went that evening to the inspector of police at Richmond and told him that I had said it was false. My mother is not here. When Mr. Tomasso asked me to go to the solicitor he did not tell me what he wanted me to say. Mr. Tomasso and I went together to the solicitor's office. It was about five or 10 minutes' walk. He said, ""Come with me and tell the truth."" He did not tell me what the truth was. He did not tell me what I was to say. Mr. Tomasso said, ""Speak the truth and tell them what you see."" It was a lie that he had given me a penny.

Re-examined. I did not want to come here. I told the solicitor that I would not come unless he gave me a letter saying that I must come. I got the letter. It is at home.

JAMES FROST , 12, Artichoke Alley. Red Lion Street, Richmond. On December 15, about 4.45, I was in Red Lion Street with Ethel Garrard and some boys and girls. I saw McEwen coming out of his door. He came up to prisoner and said, ""Why do you not stop those boys hollering?"" Prisoner said, ""I have once."" Then McEwen said, ""You are an ignorant pig,"" and prisoner said ""Am I ignorant? Death to all the pigs in Ireland."" Then McEwen knocked him on the shoulder and said he was ignorant again, and went to punch him, and then prisoner went and hit him, and he went up against

the fence. Then he got up from the fence and rushed at prisoner, and prisoner hit him again and he fell down.

Cross-examined. Prisoner got angry after he was called an ignorant pig several times, but McEwen hit him first.

FRANCIS TOMASSO (prisoner, on oath). I had never seen McEwen before. I am sorry for the man, because it wee done in an accident.

Cross-examined. It never made me angry when McEwen called me an ignorant pig. I did not tap him on the shoulder to annoy him. That ain't a game of mine, interfering with people. I thought he came up joking to me, and I did it as a kind of joke. I knocked him down after he struck me on the cheek; the blood was streaming down from my face. I pushed him away the first time; I did not hit him then. After I shoved him he rushed at me to hit me. Then I rushed at him and he went down. I did not hit him with my fist. I put my hands against his chest, because I am not a fighting man. I do not box. All the time I was in camp I, did not go in for it.

Re-examined. Some of the crowd were saying, ""Go it, Slasher,"" encouraging him to fight me. That was when we were both at it. When McEwen first came up to me I was not at ell angry with him. It is untrue that I ran behind the back of a girl and made some remark. That is all untrue; that is what makes a man get out of temper. I take my oath McEwen struck the first blow. It is not a game of mine to interfere with people. I never interfere with nobody. I always go about minding my own business. Verdict, Not guilty.

BEFORE THE RECORDER.

(Thursday, January 9.)"
Breaking Peace,"WILLIAM JENKINS , Superintendent of Police, N Division, said that his district embraced Highbury Corner, where on Sunday mornings

various speakers discoursed on different subjects. At this spot three roads converged, and a great many people on fine mornings congregated to hear the speakers. People in the adjacent private houses could also hear them. Prisoner used to have a raised stand, on which he stood. Under an Act of Parliament, the Commissioner of Police granted a permit to prisoner to make street collections up to November last, but not since. On December I witness saw prisoner at the spot in question addressing about 200 people, and heard him speak some of the words (in a loud voice) which are deposed to by Redman. Witness also saw prisoner hold up a picture, which he could not see distinctly, and at the same time prisoner said, ""Foote got 12 months for publishing this in 1883,"" and, pointing to the picture, made comments thereon. Witness also deposed to seeing prisoner on December 8 and 15, when language similar to that on the previous occasion was used.

Cross-examined. I had not attended prisoner's meetings before December 1. I knew he had addressed meetings at Highbury Corner for about 12 months before then. The meetings were, as a rule, quite orderly.

To the Judge. On December 15 prisoner indicated that his subject would be ""The Salvation Army and Sweating,"" and a good deal of his discourse related to that.

Police-constable PETER REDMAN, 347 N, produced shorthand notes which he had taken at Highbury Corner on December 1, 8, and 15, of prisoner's speeches, when the following were among the words used, ""I am going to poison all you young men this morning. I don't believe Jesus Christ ever lived or was. I am out to ridicule this foolish superstition. The people are sick to death of Christianity, and they come here for something else. I said the God of your Bible was an immoral old savage. I call the God of your Bible an immoral old savage. If I knew a man believed Christianity I would kill him. They drink their Christianity in Scotch. Here you will notice the people come out of church, and as soon as the church doors shut the pub opens. Their motto should be, 'Come unto me all who are beery and I will send you home heavily laden.' I put common sense in the place of Christianity. I don't believe in Noah and his blooming ark. People some years ago spoke loud, thinking God would hear them. They thought he was only up over the telegraph wires. Campbell calls God, 'Simple and silly.' Your God of the Bible is an immoral savage. There is no criminal in your gaols to-day who is so heartless as your Jehovah of the Jews."" Other remarks were made ridiculing the nativity of Christ.

Cross-examined. I did not take the whole of the speech, only parts.

Inspector SIDNEY SMITH, Islington, said that he arrested prisoner (on December 19 outside his house in Fairbank Street), who said, ""Who initiated the proceedings? It must have been a private person."" I said that I had done so. I laid the information. Prisoner was taken to the station.

(Thursday, February 6.)

Prisoner was not called in defence.

Verdict, Guilty.

Mr. Atherley-Jones asked his lordship to state a case on the point as to whether a direction of the late Lord Coleridge in R. v. Foote and others (15 Cox) was the test as to whether or not the words charged against prisoner constituted in law blasphemous libel, and secondly as to whether the circumstances in which the words were uttered, whereby they could be heard by passers by, including children, and might tend to a breach of the peace, should affect the question of law as to whether it was or not blasphemous libel. He also referred to an article on the subject by the late Mr. Justice Stephen.

Mr. Justice Phillimore declined to state a case.

(Saturday, February 8.)

Prisoner was released on his recognisances in £50 to come up for judgment if called upon, after giving the following undertaking: ""I do hereby express my sincere regret for the utterance of the expressions attributed to and found against me, and I promise that I will not at any meeting in public attack Christianity or the Scriptures in the language for which I have been found guilty, or in any similar language, or in any language calculated to shock the feelings or outrage the belief of the public.""

(Wednesday, January 5.)"
Killing,"ELIZA CONSTANCE CRANFIELD , domestic servant, 119, High Street, Bexley. I am Edith's sister. She was about 26 years old and was also in service at Bexley. She had kept company with prisoner for 18 or 20 months. I identified her body. This letter (A), addressed to prisoner, dated January 13, 1908, is in her handwriting and is from Elmington, Bourne Road, Bexley: ""My Own Darling Boy,—How are you by this time? I am still in the land of the living and amongst the sinners. I must say I quite enjoyed my walk on Sunday morning. It seemed quite a treat to be so fine, though I felt very miserable when I had to come in, although I did not want you to notice it to make you feel miserable too, for you seemed much happier and cheerful than you were the week before; but I expect it is all through me you are so wretched, but I do not think you can be more than I am, for my only fear is that I shall be noticed,"" etc. Signed, ""I remain, ever your own little girl, Edith."" I do not recognise the writing in the letter (C). I do not know prisoner's writing. The signature, ""Edith Cranfield,"" is my sister's, but not the rest of the letter, ""January 19, '08, 8.15 p.m.—Dear Mother,—Just a few lines to you asking you to forgive me for the wicked crime I am about to perform. After four or five months' worry Edith, the girl I love, have considered to die together. I feel sorry that I should bring this trouble upon you after having so much trouble this last few years,"" etc. Signed, ""Jack Robinson"" and ""Edith Cranfield."" Letter B contains a postscript in my sisters writing. The rest of the letter if not hers: ""Plumstead Library, 8.30 p.m., Sunday, 19, 1, '08.—""Dear Con,—I am now writing these few lines to you on behalf of your dear sister, Edith. I am very sorry to cause you and yours this trouble, but after three months' consideration we have both decided to die together, and this will take place to-night,"" etc. Signed, ""Jack Robinson.""

ARTHUR HERBERT ROBINSON , 16, Pier Road, Erith, assistant to Lloyd and Son, ironmongers. I know prisoner as a customer. About eight p.m., on January 18 last, he came in and asked for a razor. I sold him one for 2s. 8d. I identified it at the last trial as the one he bought.

CHARLES TRUNDLE , Belvedere. On Sunday evening, January 19, about 8.15, I was on Bostal Heath and met prisoner with a young woman passing Wickham Lane, not far from the Public Library, plumstead. Prisoner and I said ""Good night.""

Police-constable EDGAR CATT, 660 R. At about 1.15 a.m., on January 20, I was on duty on Bostal Heath. Prisoner came to me and I noticed he was bleeding from the throat and wrist. He said, ""I want you to take me in charge, constable, I have murdered my sweetheart."" I said, ""Are you really telling me the truth?"" He said, ""Yes, I have; that is a fact. She is on a seat this side of the bandstand."" I stopped the bleeding and took him to Dr. Holmes, at ""The Cottage,"" Bostal Heath, to whom in prisoner's presence I related our conversation. The doctor attended to his wounds. I searched him, and in his overcoat pocket I found this razor with fresh bloodstains on it. He handed me three letters. The grey one was open. The other two were in closed envelopes. I asked him for his name and address, which he gave me. At the doctor's suggestion I took him to the infirmary. Just before leaving he gave me the girl's name as ""Edith Cranfield,"" of Elmington, Bourne Road, Bexley. Sergeant Shilliter then arrived. I told him what had taken place. On the way to the infirmary prisoner said, ""She is quite dead. I made up my mind to do the job. She is pregnant by me, and I am not in a position to get married to her. We made up our minds to die together. I cut her throat and then my own and left wrist. I bought the razor at Lloyd's, Pier Road, Erith."" He was detained at the infirmary for some days.

JOHN ROBERT HOLMES , medical practitioner, ""The Cottage,"" Bostal Heath. Police-constable Catt came to my house about 1.15 a.m. on January 20 with prisoner, who had a jagged, superficial wound on his throat about 2 in. long, cutting through no important vessels, as if the edge of the instrument had been blunted. He had a wound on his left wrist about 1 1/4 in. long. No important artery was cut. I dressed the wounds. He said the body would be found on a seat by the bandstand and that she was dead. I asked him why he did it. He said, ""That is a matter best known to ourselves. She was quite willing. I cut her throat at 11.15 and I lay on the ground for an hour."" Sergeant Shilliter came in, and with him I went to Bostal Heath, where, sitting on a seat near the bandstand, we found the body. I examined the body, which was cold, as I should expect after two hours. It was leaning on the left elbow, the head resting on the back of the seat and inclined to the left. The throat was cut 4 in. in length and 1 1/4 in. deep, right through to the vertebra, dividing the carotid artery. There were three nicks in the vertebra. The head was almost severed from the body. She would have died instantaneously. At her feet was a pool of blood, and by her side a piece of brown paper, in which, probably, the razor had been wrapped. At the back of the seat there was the impression of a man's boot on the ground, and I concluded that the person who committed the crime stood behind the woman. Considerable force had been used. The three nicks must have been the result of three separate cuts. On

January 21 I made a post-mortem examination of the body. She was about six months pregnant.

Cross-examined. I do not think the appearance of the ground was consistent with the assailant having stood in front. The wound on prisoner's throat was rather gaping considering its depth. It is more difficult to inflict a serious wound on oneself than on another. I only dressed his wounds temporarily and did not, therefore, make a complete examination. I knew the police-constable had already given first aid. A small branch of the radial artery might have been severed without my noticing it. I have a general acquaintance with the subject of insanity. It is very difficult to form a correct opinion in a matter of acquired insanity where there is no predisposition. There may be insanity which is not manifested by delusions, such as impulsive insanity, where a man acts on the impulse, the act not being premeditated, and to which the patient may be driven by a blind and ungovernable morbid influence. Dr. Blandford is a known authority on insanity. I am not prepared to differ from his statement, speaking of impulsive insanity, ""There may be premeditation, but generally there is not,"" and ""The will and the reason are overpowered for a longer or shorter time."" Uncontrollable impulses are, for the most part, acts of suicide or homicide, and, there being no delusions, frequently no change would be detected in the individual. It is a fact that the impulse may be satisfied or exploded in the act, and, having thus found a vent may be felt no longer—at any rate, for a time. It may bring relief to the brain. I agree with Dr. Blandford when he says, ""Moreover, the period just after the committal of an impulsive homicidal act will very probably be the one in which fewest symptoms of insanity will be noticeable,"" and ""The period immediately preceding the committal of impulsive homicide will be that which will most closely demand scrutiny,"" etc. ""Special attention must be paid to any indication of change of conduct or disposition, which is so indicative of mental disease. The first symptom usually noticed in a person becoming insane is an alteration in his emotional condition."" It is very necessary, in the first place, to inquire into the family history of a person suspected of insanity. I know Dr Sibley as an authority on insanity and agree in what he says that, ""The forms of insanity which seem to be most directly the result of hereditary influence make their appearance in those periods of life when either rapid structural development takes place or special functional activity."" (Witness gave further technical evidence as to the symptoms and causes of insanity.) An insane person will often take the greatest dislike to a person he would otherwise be most fond of, and painful and emotional distress is often excited by the sight of a loved face. I do not agree with the theory that if a man makes no attempt to escape, but gives himself up and confesses to the crime, the presumption is in favour of insanity. The fact that a girl had become pregnant by a man would possibly cause him great depression, which might produce insanity.

Re-examined. I have not heard of impulsive insanity leading to an act of violence which had been under consideration for two months,

or which had been determined in a fortnight or three weeks before the act was committed. Exciting causes are only operative while the occasion of the excitement exists.

Sergeant FREDERICK SHILLITER, 31 R. At about one a.m., on January 20, I went to Dr. Holmes's, where I saw Police-constable Catt and prisoner. Catt said, ""This man has asked me to take him into custody as he has murdered his sweetheart on a seat on Bostal Heath, near the bandstand, and has also cut his throat and wrist with a razor,"" which was produced. Prisoner made no reply then. As they were leaving for the infirmary prisoner stopped at the gate and said, ""You know where to find her. She is on a seat near the bandstand. It was 11.15 when I did it."" I found the body as prisoner had stated and these two newspaper cuttings.

Inspector ERNEST BACCHUS. On January 21 I went to the Plumstead Infirmary and saw the prisoner, who was then able to leave. I said, ""I am now going to take you into custody for the wilful murder of Edith Cranfield."" He said, ""Yes, sir; I quite understand that."" He was then formally charged at Woolwich Police Station. When the charge was read over to him he said, ""Very good, sir,"" and afterwards added, ""You know we made up our minds to do this a fortnight or three weeks ago."" On January 28, when prisoner appeared on remand, he said, referring to the two newspaper cuttings, ""The long one I sent to the girl myself. It is a cutting from the 'Daily Mirror.' "" It referred to the joint suicide of Mr. and Mrs. Goode by drowning themselves in the Thames at Teddington.

Cross-examined. I have been in the R Division for 12 months. I have made inquiries with reference to prisoner and his father, who was once a constable in the R Division. He died in an asylum on February 22, 1899. He was admitted to an asylum twice in three years. I find the prisoner went into the Army when he was 15 1/2, and that he served in the South African War, obtaining the Queen's medal with three clasps and the King's with two. He then went to India and served for three years and 310 days, returning on January 2, 1906. He suffered from enteric fever. I have no reason to doubt it, and that he had malarial fever. He was transferred to the Army Reserve in August last with a certificate of conduct marked ""Good."" I know his mother is very ill and unable to attend. I know prisoner's eldest brother is mentally deficient.

Re-examined. There is no record of any delusions or mental deficiency of the prisoner in the whole course of his service in the Army. On his discharge he was employed as a tram conductor by the Erith Urban District Council from September, 1906, to January, 1907. There is no record of delusions or insanity during that service. He then worked as a labourer at the engineering works at Erith until Friday, January 17, 1908, earning 24s. or 25s. a week. No suggestion of delusion or insanity. He did not go to work on Saturday, January 18. Sergeant Hancock made inquiries of prisoner's mother.

Sergeant HENRY HANCOCK, R Division. I made inquiries of prisoner's mother in his hearing and that of the female members of the family and took a statement from her. She is too ill to go out. Her

husband died in an asylum in 1899. The family consists of five sons (four living) and one daughter. The eldest son was injured by an operation at his birth and has had three fits, the third leaving him paralysed. The others, as far as their minds are concerned, are all right. She said prisoner was the brightest of the family and always had been, but he had been very quiet since Christmas. On January 18 she said to her daughter, ""If he does not alter he will go out of his mind.""

OSCAR ROBINSON (prisoner's brother). I know prisoner's writing. Letter C is in his writing. I am not sure of the other (B).

Cross-examined. He has had a rather vacant look since Christmas. I said at the last trial he had seemed a bit funny or strange. I have seen a ""bolting"" in his eyes or a stare. He came home on Boxing Day about seven p.m. and went to bed without any apparent reason. Before Christmas he was very particular about his clothes and appearance, but since then he has become careless and has made strange remarks. He used to say of the clock (which he said his father said), ""I will give you tick, tick, you old b——."" He said he had sent things home from India which we had never got—a pig's head, for instance, and a six-guinea cape for mother. At one time he was a teetotaler and then took to drinking a little. He was a heavy smoker. We have had a good deal of trouble in our family the last year or so, and my sister has had a serious operation. One Saturday night, since Christmas, mother said, ""If Jack does not leave the drink alone he will go out of his mind.""

Re-examined. He had been drinking on the quiet, I fancy, since Christmas. He was depressed and went irregularly to his work. He never told me of the determination he had come to. There was nothing the matter with my sister Daisy's mind.

ERNEST BACCHUS , recalled. Scars on the back of the prisoner's head are mentioned in his medical description. There is no explanation of them.

Rev. GEORGE ADOLPHUS SAMUEL ADAMS, Vicar of Erith. I have known prisoner for 13 years. He was in my Sunday School and Band of Hope. When he was 13 or 14 I thought him distinctly weak in mind. The most definite occasion was when he was employed as a messenger boy in a draper's shop. I was struck by a peculiar look he gave me when on a ladder at the window, and I went home and alluded to it, and said, ""Fancy their taking crocky Arthur Robinson into their shop!"" I remembered it when he returned to Erith from India. I cautioned him last year and said, ""Be careful to leave drink alone. If you do not leave alcohol alone you will die in an asylum."" He said, ""I hope not, sir."" I said, ""Mark my words, you will,"" and I spoke of the insanity that showed itself in his father. What was in my mind then was what I had noticed when he was 13 or 14. He came to see me on his return from India and I had a general friendly talk with him. He was not drinking, so far as I knew, at the time. I advised him very strongly to keep thoroughly steady. I knew his father. His weakness was notorious. I saw prisoner on the night of January 17 waiting at a dinner given to

the old people of the parish. He hurried past me, and one thought that came to my mind was the condition of his eyes—gleaming and rolling.

Cross-examined. Prisoner's father was not a hard drinker until after the first frenzy of madness came on him, and he then had to be taken to an asylum. I believe prisoner was a teetotaler till October last. He was discharged from the Army in August, and was then engaged as a tram conductor. He had two or three suspensions; not in reference to his moral character, but he was volatile, careless, and talkative. He left the service about January last. He then went into hospital to have varicose veins treated to see if he could get into the City Police, and when he came out that idea had vanished. Then he worked as a labourer at the engineering works. I have not seen him much since Christmas.

Dr. JAMES SCOTT, medical officer, Brixton Prison. Prisoner was received at the prison on January 21 last and has been kept under close observation in the hospital ward. I have had many conversations with him and see no signs of insanity.

Cross-examined. Cases of insanity without delusions are reported in the text books. I have not met with many. They are reported in cases of impulsive insanity. He told me he had suffered from enteric fever. Sometimes insanity follows on some diseases of the intestines. If malarial fever were of long duration and produced great exhaustion it might increase a predisposition to insanity. He told me he had an attack of malaria in India. I am informed he was correct as to having had enteric. In cases of impulsive insanity a homicidal act is not infrequently followed by a period of calm. ""General paralysis of the insane"" is not so hereditary as other forms. All cases differ. The strain of a campaign in South Africa might affect some sensitive natures, but not many. Exposure to great heat, if prolonged and causing great exhaustion, might increase predisposition. A man taking largely to drink, after being a teetotaler, would be more susceptible. A girl becoming pregnant by him would cause mental depression in many cases. It is remotely possible that it would produce an attack of insanity where there was hereditary taint. Many nervous children show peculiarities at the time of adolescence. I agree with the passage read from Dr. Sibley.

Verdict, Guilty. Recommended to mercy on the ground that the jury thought that prisoner was largely controlled by the superior will of the deceased woman.

Sentence, Death.

BEFORE THE RECORDER.

(Wednesday, March 4.)"
Theft,"GEORGE HERBERT DUCKWORTH . I live at 35, Charles Street, Berkeley Square, and am private secretary of a Treasury Committee. Last November prisoner called upon me, having previously seen my wife, to ask if I would help him, she having referred him to me. I made inquiries with a view to seeing if he was worth helping and was satisfied that I should be justified in helping him, and I did. He called on me on December 4 or 5, and I fitted him up with clothes, and he was to go that day to a convalescent home at Bexhill. When he was about starting I gave him 10s. for the journey to Bexhill, leaving him 4s. for himself. Two or three days afterwards he turned up again and said he was living in a Rowton House, that it was an old system of dormitory, and that his neighbour, while he was asleep,

had leaned over and taken his money from him, that he had not liked to come back and ask for more, and had tried to earn some, but had been unable to do so, and so had come back to me to ask whether I would give him sufficient money to go down to the convalescent home. I sent a man with him to the station to take his ticket and see him off. I did not see him again until, I think, January 24, he having previously asked to have his time renewed at the home. I said I had made inquiries as to that, and the people at the home did not want to have him back. I had written to him before that, sending him 10s. to take him back to his own people in the country, so that he should not come back to London at all. He said he had not been able to go home and he wanted further help. There was some demur to giving him further help and it appeared that while I was away he had threatened to commit suicide, which caused considerable stir. However, he was not given anything. He came back after I had returned. Having heard that he had threatened to commit suicide I sent him out some breakfast into the hall. When he had finished I went out and talked to him, telling him that he had behaved in a cowardly manner and that he was not the sort of person I cared to help and that it was a cowardly thing to cause fear and distress in the way he had done. He then said, ""Well, there will be nothing left for me except suicide."" I showed him the door after that, and said he was not the kind of person I would have any more dealings with. About February 8 I received the following letter purporting to come from him:

""Mr. Duckworth.—Sir,—I am writing to you for the last time, and I now demand an apology and my references and £10 for your treating me as you did, like a dog, the last time I saw you. I would not give you the chance only for my great respect for her ladyship for her true kindness to me. She is not only a lady by title, but a true natured lady, but you are not a gentleman. You sent me to Bexhill without a penny to do anything with. That was not her ladyship's doings. I have nothing to thank you for, after you got my references and treating me as you did. You have hardened my heart, and I will not stop at anything if you don't grant my request. I will call at 7.30 this evening for an answer, and you can have all the police from Scotland Yard if you like. If you don't grant my request, as the sun shines above us I will kill you. Now help me or do your worst.—I am yours etc., F. Young.""

There is no date on the letter, on receipt of which I sent for the police. I think it came on a Saturday and on the following Monday prisoner called at my house at 7.40. Inspector Bower and Sergeant Leach were there to receive him. I was not present when he came.

INSPECTOR BOWER, C Division. I was at No. 35, Charles Street about 7.40 on February 10. Prisoner came to the door and gave the name of Frederick Young. I went forward and said, ""I believe you have come to see Mr. Duckworth? You sent this letter."" He replied. ""Yes, I did send it to him."" I said, ""We are police officers,"" and told him the charge. He made no reply. Sergeant Leach took him to the station.

Sergeant LEACH, C Division. On the way to the station prisoner said, ""I was going to call this morning at half-past 10. When I went on Saturday evening for an answer to my letter the servant told me that Mr. Duckworth would probably send an answer; so I waited at home until seven o'clock this evening. As he did not I came along to the house.""

The statement of the prisoner before the Magistrate was to the effect that he did not intend to do what he said.

Verdict, Guilty.

Sentence, Three years' penal servitude.

BEFORE JUDGE LUMLEY SMITH.

(Tuesday, March 10.)"
Royal Offences,"FREDERICK HOLMAN . I am manager of the ""New Inn,"" Westminster Bridge Road, of which my father is proprietor. At a quarter to two on Saturday, February 22, prisoner came in to the bar and asked for half a pint of ale✗ and a packet of cigarettes. He tendered in payment what appeared to be a five-shilling piece. I picked it up and said, ""This is counterfeit."" I had taken two other counterfeit crown pieces within five weeks. They are all dated 1890. My father asked prisoner where he got it from, and he said it was part of his wages, which he had just been paid. My father told me to fetch a constable and I did so. In the presence of the constable prisoner said that he received the crown piece in part change of a sovereign.

To prisoner. I do not recollect your having ever come into the place before. There are seven of us in the bar, and we serve several hundred customers a day.

Police-constable NORMAN MACDONALD, 394 L. I was called to Mr. Holman's house at 1.45 on Saturday, February 22. He prodused the five-shilling piece, and pointed out prisoner as the man who had passed the bad coin.

(Wednesday, April 1.)

NORMAN MACDONALD , further examined. I said to prisoner, ""you heard what the landlord said."" He replied, ""Yes, quite right. I received it with my wages this afternoon. I work for Bailey, Sell, and Co., Newgate Street, E.O. The clerk paid me at 1.30 this afternoon."" I said, ""What money did he pay you?"" He said, ""10s. in gold, two half-crowns, and a five-shilling piece."" He produced a 10s. piece, and twopence in bronze, and I asked him what had become of the remaining 4s. 10d. He said, ""I paid 'Jack the Lighterman,' of 55, Belvedere Road, two shillings which I owed to him."" Belvedere Road is in Lambeth, and runs out of the Westminster Bridge Road. The landlord produced another five-shilling piece, saying that both coins were similar in appearance, and bore the same date, and I told prisoner I should take him to the station for inquiries as to the truth of his statement. He replied, ""Do not do that; I will give you my name and address."" He gave as his address 55, Belvedere Road, which is a common lodging-house. Inquiries were subsequently made at Newgate Street. ""Jack the Lighterman"" was sent for, and at the station said, in the presence of prisoner, ""I have not seen you all day."" In reply to that prisoner said, ""Well, I suppose I am in the wrong.""

Sergeant JOHN COURSE, L Division. I saw prisoner detained at Penton Place Police Station. I asked him the number of Bailey and Co., in Newgate Street, and he said 38. I asked him who ""Jack the Lightermen"" was, and what he owed him two shillings for? He said, ""It is what I owed him, and that is all I want to say about it."" I was present when ""Jack the Lighterman"" came to the station, and was spoken to with reference to the two shillings. In the presence of prisoner he said he had not seen him since the previous night. Prisoner then said, ""All right, I suppose I am wrong."" I asked him how long he had been at Bailey's, and he said two years, and that he had lived at 55, Belvedere Road, five years. I afterwards made inquiries in Newgate Street. The premises, 36 to 41, are wholly occupied by Messrs. Faudel Phillips. I have searched and made inquiries in all this district, but no such firm as Bailey's is mentioned in the directories nor anywhere else, as far as I can find.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , of the Mint, said the three coins produced were counterfeit and from the same mould, and were not of very good make.

Prisoner declined to give evidence on oath, but addressing the jury said he was that worried with one constable and the other and that excited he did not know what he was saying. The previous day he had drawn a sovereign from a bookmaker in Soho in respect of a bet, but he did not want the man to get into trouble by doing so as it would give him (prisoner) bad name. He changed the sovereign in the ""George,"" in Shaftesbury Avenue, and went home drunk. Next morning he went to the market to buy a few flowers and coming home he called to have a drink at this public-house and offered this five-shilling piece to change. Any man was liable to have a counterfeit

coin on him, but he had sufficient good money to pay for what he had. He wanted money also to pay for two nights' lodging.

Verdict, Guilty. Previous convictions were proved, dating back to 1894.

Sergeant JOHN COURSE stated that at the police court he asked prisoner if he could tell him of any place where he had been employed or give any information of his general habits, and prisoner informed him that he had been selling papers, but could give no reference to anybody.

Sentence, Four years' penal servitude.

BEFORE MR. JUSTICE WALTON.

(Wednesday, April 1.)"
Sexual Offences,"Mr. Leycester stated that prisoner married a woman named Leah Benedict on February 1 of this year and the woman Novick eight days later, and prisoner's allegation was that the first marriage was bad, as the woman had a husband living in Russia, from whom, however, she alleged she had been divorced. The burden of proof was on the prosecution to prove that the divorce was valid, and this, of course, was a matter of evidence. Judges in this country were not supposed to know the laws of foreign countries, and what the law of Russia is must be proved by evidence, and the only evidence with which he had been supplied was that of Mr. Feldman, Ecclesiastical Assessor to the Chief Rabbi, who, having inspected the bill of divorce, held it to be good, and that the woman, so far as the Jewish religion was concerned, was free to marry again.

The Common Serjeant. He means that the Jews would consider that a good divorce, but it certainly would not be a good divorce in England. You cannot get rid of your wife in England by saying she is not your wife.

Mr. Leyceater. It would save a good deal of trouble in the High Court if that could be done. Mr. Feldman was questioned on the point before the magistrate, and said he believed the divorce would be recognised in Russia, but he really did not know and was not prepared to say so definitely.

The Common Serjeant said he would hear the evidence.

ASHER FELDMAN , Ecclesiastical Assessor to the Chief Rabbi in London. As to the duties of my office, we have a double function. All cases referring to ecclesiastical law and cases connected with Jewish matters come before us. I am not a Russian lawyer, but in the course of our procedure one comes into contact with so many cases, and I live amongst the population, and in virtue of daily contact with their ways and manners I know a good deal of the practice of Russian law. I have seen the decree of divorce in this case. It is written in Hebrew. It does not bear the seal of any court. These documents never have. (Witness proceeded to translate the document.) This is a bill of divorce according to the law of Moses and of Israel.

The Common Serjeant. This is notice from the husband to the wife that she is free to do as the likes and is not his wife any more. There is no reason given as the ground of divorce. It does not say that she committed adultery or anything else.

Mr. Leycester. Do you know what legal effect, if any, that would have in Russia?

Witness. In Russia it would free the wife to marry, because the Jews in Russia are allowed to marrv in accordance with their own rites, and that marriage is recognised by the law of the land, and in a

similar way divorce, according to Russian law, as far as my knowledge goes, is recognised by the law of the land.

The Common Serjeant. In Russia people get rid of their wives whenever they like.

Witness. Well, I must say the law of divorce is not as stringent as in this country. Under Jewish law the married can get a divorce by mutual consent.

The Common Serjeant. I am not satisfied that the Russian law is that this is a real secular civil divorce. It may be that in Russia they allow the Jews to do as they like.

Verdict, Not guilty, by direction of the Judge.

BEFORE JUDGE RENTOUL.

(Wednesday, April 1.)"
Deception,"ALBERT EDWARD WATERS , postman at the Stockwell Sorting Office. I know that prisoner in January last was residing in my district. Letters posted in the Stockwell district would have to be brought to the office at which I am on duty, and it would be my duty to stamp letters, cards, and so on to be forwarded in the ordinary course. Amongst the correspondence I had to deal with on January 27 was the card produced, addressed to the proprietor of the Grosvenor Park Crescent Ladies' Club, Grosvenor Place, Hyde Park Corner. It was stamped for the 12.30 p.m. collection, and as I was stamping it I happened to notice that the stamp had been used before, so I initialled it and handed it to the overseer on duty, Mr. Hicks. I am well acquainted with the handwriting on that card. It is the prisoner's. I have known him close upon three years. Cards in that writing pass though my hands continually.

EDWARD GEORGE HICKS , head postman at Stockwell Post Office. On looking at the card handed to me by the last witness I noticed that the obliterated stamp had been previously used. I submitted it to the postmaster, who stopped it from circulation, and it was forwarded to the Postmaster-General.

GEORGE WHITE , hall porter at the Grosvenor Park Ladies' Club. About the end of November last an assistant footman was advertised for. An application was received from prisoner, and I made an appointment for him to call and see me. He called some six weeks after and had an interview with me, and I told him at once that I thought he was not suitable. He did not go away at once but waited about 10 minutes. Afterwards he applied by letter to the secretary, in the name of Montague, for his fare and expenses. The letter with enclosures was sent back as it came.

THOMAS HENRY POPLETT , head postman at the South Kensington Sorting Office. Up to February, 1906, I was at the Stockwell District Office and acted as inquiry officer. The handwriting on the card produced is that of the prisoner. I have had several occasions of becoming acquainted with his handwriting. On March 30 I accompanied Detective-sergeant Ebbage to prisoner's lodgings in Brixton, and was present when the card was shown to him. He turned to me and said, ""You might have given me another warning."" I had warned him previously.

Detective-sergeant ROBERT EBBAGE , Brixton. On March 30 I received a warrant for prisoner's arrest, and on that date called at his rooms at 88, Dalyell Road, Stockwell, accompanied by last witness. As soon as prisoner saw me he said, ""What, again!"" I said, ""Yes, I have a warrant for your arrest."" I read it to him, and at the same time showed him the postcard and said, ""This is the postcard and stamp referred to in the warrant."" He replied, ""What is a poor devil to do looking for work?"" I then searched him, and found on him 11 cancelled postage stamps. Whilst doing so he turned to the witness Poplett and said, ""You might have given me another warning."" Prisoner was taken to the station. I searched him and found upon him £1 5s. 6 1/2 d., and deposit notes to the amount of £240. He was living in a small back room for which he paid 2s. 3d. per week.

WILLIAM NORWOOD EAST , assistant medical officer, Brixton Prison. Prisoner was admitted on March 31, and Dr. Scott and I have had him under observation. Dr. Scott went on leave on the 11th of this month. When prisoner came in I examined him and thought he was insane. He was demented. By that I mean a condition of mental enfeeblement; he is childish, and says he is related to lords and dukes and to the celebrated painter, Sir Joshua Reynolds. I think those are probably insane delusions. He is quite harmless. Dr. Scott concurred in my view. Prisoner has been weak-minded for a long time. I have known him since November, 1906. He was not then so bad as he is now. He seems to have deteriorated. I am of opinion that he would not improve under treatment, but is incurable. I think he is incapable by reason of the state of his mind of distinguishing between right and wrong.

The jury found prisoner Guilty, but insane and not responsible in law, and the Recorder directed that he be confined in Brixton during His Majesty's pleasure."
Royal Offences,"FANNY GOWER . I am the daughter of Frank Leveson Gower, who keeps the ""Duke of Wellington"" Hotel at Hounslow. On Monday, May 11, about noon, prisoner entered the bar rather hurriedly and asked for a glass of stout and mild, the price of which is 11/2 d., and he tendered in payment what appeared to be a five-shilling piece. My father was coming into the bar at the time and I handed it to him. My father first cut the edge with a knife and then broke the coin in the tester. He asked prisoner where he got it, and prisoner replied that he got it at Hurst Park. My father then asked him if he had any pals outside. Prisoner put twopence on the counter to pay for his drink and turned to leave the bar, but my father had him detained by calling to a customer in the bar to bolt the door. I then went for a constable, to whom my father gave the five-shilling piece. FRANK LEVESON GOWER . I asked prisoner where he got the five-shilling piece from, and he said, ""From Hurst Park Races on Saturday."" I held it in front of him, and asked if he had any more of them. He put out his hand for it, but I said, ""No."" He mentioned the name of a bookmaker I did not recognise. It was some such name as Poluski Brothers. I said to him, ""Where is your pal?"" He answered, ""I do not know what you mean. You are asking a saucy question."" I said, ""I do not think so. When you come with these games you never come single-handed."" He then said, ""You have made a mistake this time, governor. I am going to North Hyde Schools. I used to be there at school myself and I am going to see ""—I would not be certain whether he said ""my nephew"" or ""my cousin."" I said, ""Why do you come this way if you are going to North Hyde Schools?"" He said, ""I suppose I can go which way I like."" Hounslow is not on the way from London to North Hyde Schools. I turned round then, put the coin in the tester, and broke it. He said, ""Is that the way you test your coins?"" I said ""Yes."" He said, ""It wants a tidy one to stand that."" I said, ""It appears yours won't."" He said, ""I will pay for what I have had,"" and put down 2d. He finished his drink and turned towards the door. I called out to a man in the bar to bolt the door.

Prisoner, asked if he wished to put any question to the witness, denied that he said he got the coin from a bookmaker, but from a bookstall, and, with regard to his going to North Hyde School, said he had two nephews there, but not having been there for twenty years, he had forgotten the way.

Police-constable PATRICK FLYNN , 219, T, stated that he searched prisoner and found on him £1/2 d. Prisoner said to him, ""You are exceeding your duty. The police in London do not search us for this."" After I had finished searching him he said, ""You are satisfied

now. Let me go away."" On the way to the station he said he bought two papers at a bookstall in Hurst Park, tendering half a sovereign, and must have got the five-shilling piece in change. He gave the name of O'Rourke, with an address at Rowton House, Fieldgate Street, Whitechapel.

Detective-sergeant WILLIAM HAILSTONE , T Division, spoke to making inquiries concerning prisoner at Rowton House, Fieldgate Street, where prisoner was unknown. The record book was searched for several weeks, but there was no such name in it.

The following evidence was given with reference to an attempt of prisoner to pass a bad coin on a previous occasion.

ELIZABETH RICHARDS , assistant to Mr. Jones, dairyman, 98, Shoe Lane, E.C. Prisoner came into the shop at about nine o'clock in the evening of March 17 and asked for three penny scones and tendered a five-shilling piece, which I took to Mr. Jones at the back of the shop. Mr. Jones asked him where he got it from and a policeman was sent for.

EVANS HOPKINS JONES . When I asked prisoner where he got the five-shilling piece he said, ""I got it from where I was working. I changed soms coppers in a public-house in London Wall and got the five-shilling piece in exchange."" I sent for the police. I am sure prisoner is the man. I saw him at the Mansion House.

Police-constable ARTHUR DODDS , 200, City. I received prisoner into custody on March 17. He stated that he had been out selling shamrock and had got a lot of coppers which he exchanged at a public-house in London Wall, the name of which he did not know, for the five-shilling piece. He made a similar statement at the station. He was brought before the magistrate at the Mansion House, remanded, and finally discharged.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , an officer of His Majesty's Mint, said both the coins were counterfeit and not from the same mould. They were very well made, but very much lighter than genuine coin, the difference in weight being as much as 100 gr.

Verdict, Guilty.

Police-constable THOMAS WHITING , 917, City, said he was present at the Mansion House on September 10, when prisoner was sentenced to three months' hard labour for larceny from the person (snatching). There were then seven previous convictions against him.

Sentence, Nine months' imprisonment."
Theft,"Detective EDWARD MARRIOTT , City. On May 13 I accompanied prosecutor to No. 5, Angel Lane, Stratford, premises occupied by Mr. Alexander Franklin. There were there produced four lengths of dark cloth, now in Court. I afterwards went to prisoner's address in Fort Street, Spitalfields, in company with Mr. Wacholder and Mr. Thompson. I said we were police officers investigating a case of warehouse breaking, in which a large quantity of cloth had been stolen, some of which had been traced to Mr. Franklin and Mr. Wacholder, who said they had got it from prisoner. Prisoner replied, ""I know nothing about the cloth."" I told him I did not believe the statement, and was going to search his place. In a bedroom on the second floor I saw Sergeant Stewart find three lengths of grey cloth covered up with some wearing apparel. I asked him where he got it from, and he said that three young men brought the lengths to him to make up into overcoats. I asked him who they were. He said he did not know their names as he never took the names and addresses of customers when they left material. I told him I did not believe his statement, and he must consider himself in custody. I took him to Moor Lane Station, where he was charged with breaking and entering prosecutor's warehouse, and stealing 14 rolls of cloth of the value of £180, and he replied, ""Is that all?"" The light cloth produced is marked with the number, ""57.""

Cross-examined. Prosecutor's warehouse was broken into some time between six at night of May 8 and eight in the morning of May 9. Fourteen rolls were stolen, and I think there are 60 yards in each roll. At the house of prisoner Wacholder said, ""This is the man I bought the cloth of."" Prisoner replied, ""What cloth? Are you mad?"" I did not hear Wacholder say anything in reply to that. Prisoner said to Wacholder that he had never sold him any cloth. There was not more than enough of the pieces of grey cloth to make an overcoat each. Cohen was carrying on business as a tailor at this address. It is a private house, and the workshop is at the back of the house.

Re-examined. There was no other cloth in the bedroom. The cloth was covered with four or five pieces of clothing, and was not sufficient to conceal the existence of the clothing from any person casually entering the room.

MEYER WACHOLDER , 254, Commercial Road. I carry on the business of a job buyer, and deal in job lines of goods. I have known Cohen eight or nine years. On Monday, May 11, he brought down four remnants of cloth between nine and 10 in the morning. He asked me whether I could do with these four lines, and I said, ""Yes."" I asked him what was the price, and he said 10s. a piece. I asked him where he had got it from, and he said, ""I think you know me long enough. You need not ask me where I got that from."" I offered him 9s. a piece. I took him down to a customer of mine in Stratford, Alexander Franklin, 5, Angel Lane, to whom I sold them for 10s. 6d. a piece. In the regular way they were worth

about 13s. a piece. On May 13 I was visited by Detective Marriott in company with Mr. Franklin, and in consequence of what was told me then I visited prisoner's premises at Fort Street, Spitalfields. I said to Marriott, ""This is the man I had those remnants from."" Prisoner replied that I was mad. I saw some light-coloured cloth on his premises.

Cross-examined. I first knew that the police were making inquiries about the cloth on Wednesday, the 13th. Job buyers do not usually keep stock long on their premises. I have never had any quarrel with Mr. Cohen, and have never been on unfriendly terms with him. If it appears on the depositions that I said, ""The quarrel three years ago was about my brother. We have have not been on friendly terms since."" I may possibly have misunderstood what was said to me. As to the statement in the depositions that I knew the police were making inquiries about this cloth, I did not know it until they came on the afternoon of the 13th. If prisoner is going to swear that he did not sell me the cloth I shall say that is a lie, and the jury will have to decide between us. Marriott said to prisoner at his house, ""I am a police officer, and am making inquiries about a case of warehouse breaking, where a large quantity of cloth was stolen. Four pieces have been traced to this gentleman (pointing to me) and he says he got them from you. Now where did you get them from?"" I do not remember that Cohen replied, ""I have never sold this man any cloth."" I have been in England 16 years.

ABRAHAM BAUM , 284, Commercial Road. Wacholder is my son-in-law. I had never seen prisoner till he came down to my son-in-law's place on the Monday. I was downstairs when I heard a knock. I looked up and saw this young fellow walking up the steps, following my son-in-law. I am sure prisoner is the man. This occurred between half-past nine and 10.

Cross-examined. I was looking to see if my workpeople were coming in when I saw prisoner. I was anxious to see them come in. They come and ask me whether there is work. It is of no use for me to go to the workshop if they are not there. I did not see the police and Mr. Franklin when they came and saw my son-in-law. I have known Wacholder six years. I do not know that Harry Wacholder was working for prisoner at one time. I heard Mr. Margetts, Cohens solicitor, ask Wacholder at the Guildhall whether there had been a quarrel with Cohen three years ago about Wacholder's brother.

JULIUS MARCUS THOMPSON , wholesale woollen merchant, 2, New Zealand Avenue, E.C. I occupy the ground floor and basement. On going to the premises on Saturday, May 9, I found they had been broken open, and a quantity of cloth, nine pieces of the value of £120, had been stolen. On May 13 I received certain information, and made a communication to the police. I afterwards went with the police to the premises of Mr. Franklin, Angel Lane, Stratford. I there saw the four pieces of dark cloth produced. I identify it by certain markings. It costs from 13 to 14s., and it is absolutely

impossible that it should be sold at such a price as 10s. 6d. I afterwards went with Wacholder and the police to Cohen's premises, and was shown some other cloth of a light colour, which I also identify. It is of very good quality, and the price is from 16s. to 18s. per length. It is a suiting, and is not suitable for overcoats.

Cross-examined. It is impossible to obtain this material from anybody but myself, as this pattern is mine. I pay as much as a small purchaser in order to preserve that pattern, or within 21/2 per cent. No one with any experience of cloth would buy that cloth for 9s. a length. It could not be bought honestly for that money by anybody who knew anything of cloth.

ADAM COCHRANE , tweed manufacturer, Galashiels, identified the light tweed as being the manufacture of his firm.

GEORGE DUGGUIA , London representative of Messrs. H. and S. Butterworth, gave similar evidence with regard to the dark cloth.

Cross-examined. The cloth could not be honestly sold for 9s. per piece of that length.

(Defence.)

DAVIS COHEN (prisoner, on oath). I am a master tailor, carrying on business at 2, Fort Street, Bishopsgate, and have been established there some 31/2 years. Previously to that I was at No. 14 for seven years. I regularly employ seven hands and sometimes more. I have been in England 21 years and have never had a charge of any kind brought against me. There are gentlemen here who have known me and are prepared to give me the highest character. I have known Wacholder nine or ten years. He is a rag sorter and job buyer. I had a quarrel with him about four years ago. His brother worked for me at the time. I turned him off and Wacholder and I have never spoken since. I have never in my life sold any cloth to Wacholder. Some years ago I need to sell him cuttings, but nothing since the quarrel. When the police-sergeant stated that Wacholder had said that he got the four pieces of cloth from me, I said, ""I do not know anything about it. You must be mad. I have not seen you now for three years."" There is not a word of truth in what Wacholder has sworn that on the Monday morning I went round to his place with these four lengths of cloth and asked him 10s. for it, finally taking 9s. I have never been on his premises. The three pieces of light cloth found by the police were in one of the children's bedrooms. I did not go upstairs with the police. I myself placed the cloth on a chair. On that Wednesday, about half-past four, one of the girls sent three fellows up into the workshop on the top floor. I have not any shop or board downstairs. The customers generally recommend one another. I had never seen either of these men before. They said they had been sent there and asked could I make up three overcoats by Saturday. Each had a parcel containing a piece of stuff. I said it was impossible to get them done at the end of the week, as I was rather busy; but, anyhow, I would go down to the tailor who made coats for me and see if he could make them, and if he

could not they must take the stuff away or leave the order till next week. They waited while I went to the tailors in Boundary Passage, but he could not get them done. I then returned to the workshop and asked the three men to call again on Sunday, as I had not time to measure them then, which would take at least half an hour. They each left, me 5s. for the trimmings, which I bought the same afternoon. The police asked Thompson if the trimmings were his property and he said he did not sell trimming. I myself put the cloth in the bedroom as I thought it would get dirty in the workshop. There were two workmen in the shop at the time, Julius Cohen and Sam Schoful, the girls having gone down to tea. On the morning of Monday, 11th, at the time Wacholder says I was in Commercial Road, I saw Joseph Levy in the ""Ship and Blue Ball,"" and his employer. Mr. Gilberg, was also there. I have waistcoats from Gilberg to make up, and he generally makes my coats. I remained at the public-house until half-past, 11. It would take me, I should say, just half an hour to go from there to Commercial Road.

Cross-examined. Wacholder's statement as to my having visited him on the Monday morning is an absolute fabrication. The name of the girl who showed the three men up is Annie Lussman. I believe she is here. I should say their ages were between 25 and 32. They were of rather nice appearance and smartly dressed, not by me, and looked to be quite respectable people. They paid 5s. each for the trimmings. I have never seen them since. I did not mention at the police court the presence of these witnesses. The question was not brought up at all.

Re-examined. By the advice of my solicitor I said at the Guild-hall that I reserved my defence. My witnesses were present and ready to be called.

ABRAHAM LEVY , glass traveller, Fort Street, WILLIAM CHARLES OVARY, master builder, Fort Street, and FREDERICK WEBSER, carrying on business at 28, Spital Square, gave evidence as to character.

DANIEL GILBERG , tailor, No. 1, Boundary Passage. Cohen has been making waistcoats for me for five or six years. For some 13 years before that he had been working for my father. He has always borne the character of an honest and honourable man. When he has overcoats to make he brings them to me to make. On the morning of Monday, May 11, I saw prisoner at my place. As near as possible he would be there at half-past nine. He came for work in the usual way. I told him there was no work, but he could come back about dinner time, and he then went away. I afterwards saw him in the ""Ship and Blue Ball"" with a man who works for me, just on 11 o'clock, I should think it was. Cohen calls to see me three times a day. On the afternoon of Wednesday, May 13, he came to see me about some overcoat work. I told him I could not make them that week; I was too busy. Next day I heard he had been arrested.

Cross-examined. There was nothing unusual in him calling on the Monday morning or the Wednesday afternoon.

ANNIE LUSSMAN . I am employed by prisoner. I remember the Wednesday when the police came and he was arrested. On the same

afternoon three men had called to see him. It was about half-past four. I was downstairs having tea at the time. They asked to see the governor. I sent them up to the workshop. Each of them was carrying a brown paper parcel.

Cross-examined. They were all young men and smartly dressed. I had never seen them before and have not seen them since. I made a statement to Mr. Margett's clerk.

JULIUS COHEN . I am a workman in prisoners employ but no relation. I recollect Cohen being taken away by the police on May 13. I was in the workshop that afternoon and a man named Schoful was there, too. Three men came up and wanted three overcoats made. Prisoner said he did not know whether he could do them, but would go and ask. When he came back he said he could not do them for that week, but would put them away till the next week. The men brought the stuff with them. They were to come on Sunday to be measured. I do not think anything else was said. They gave prisoner money for trimmings, but I do not know how much. They left the cloth when they went away.

Cross-examined. Each of the men opened his own parcel. They were all young men.

SAM SCHOFUL . I am employed by Cohen, and remember the day the police took him away. I was working upstairs in the workroom that afternoon. Julius Cohen was also working there. Three men came in and ordered three overcoats, bringing the cloth with them. (Witness gave other corroborative evidence.)

Verdict, Not guilty."
Breaking Peace,"GEORGE WHITE (prosecutor). I am 18 years of age and live at Cuperlow Court in the Minories, and am a van guard in the employ of the London and South-Western Railway Company. On June 12, about half-past one, I was in Goodman's yard. Prisoner came to me and said, ""What about this fight?"" I replied that I would fight him in the night time. He then pulled a knife out from his sleeve, made a run at me, and stuck it in the right side of my chest. I had my waistcoat open. I fell down by the office door and was picked up and taken to hospital. I only saw the blade of the knife. I did not see what he did with it.

To the Court. I have known him about 10 years. He is employed by the Great Eastern Railway Company. I had had no quarrel with him. He came up to me and said, ""What about this fight?"" He was sober. I do not know what he came round for. He said it was a fight between me and him, and I said, ""I will fight you in the evening.""

Cross-examined. I know nothing about fighting. I have heard of a gang of boys called the ""Forties,"" but I do not know anything about their going about the City and Stepney night after night with revolvers, knives, and things of that sort. I have only been out with them once or twice. I only know a couple of them. I went down with them to see this lad (prisoner). It was suggested at the police court that I was ringleader of the gang, but that is not so. I said before the magistrate that prisoner was a member of the ""Forties"" and left, but it is not true that because he left the gang I would have nothing more to do with him. It is not true that a number of boys,

including myself, got round him with revolvers and knives the day before this happened. I was not carrying a revolver then. I have never carried a revolver. Prisoner and I had been good friends before. I did not ask him why he wanted to fight me. His coming up to me was quite a surprise. I was not very much injured and was able to attend the police court next day and to return to work on Monday.

Re-examined. I am not a member of the ""Forties,"" but I went down with three or four of them to see this lad. They said they wanted to go and see him about something. I do not know what the gang exists for.

THOMAS HENRY SMITH , 17, Stewart Mansions, Camberwell. I am a carman in the employ of the London and South-Western Railway. On June 12 I was in Goodman's yard standing outside my office door. Prosecutor was with me. Prisoner, whom I now know as Roger Hellen, came up to my boy (prosecutor) and said, ""What about this fight?"" and my boy replied, ""I will flght you to-night."" Then, without any warning, prisoner drew a knife and stabbed him on the right breast. He then turned round and ran away. I chased him and caught him up by the Mint. I saw the knife. My boy had done nothing to annoy prisoner.

Police-constable JOHN COLLEY , 872, City. On June 12, about 1.50 p.m., I was outside the Mint. I saw a crowd and on going to see what was the matter found last witness holding prisoner. Smith said, ""This chap (prisoner) has stabbed my boy."" I took prisoner into custody. I took him to Coodman's Yard where the affair had happened, and then to the police station. When I arrested prisoner, he said, ""Yes; I did it. They have all been on to me. I threw it away under the arch"" (meaning the knife). I did not find it.

Cross-examined. When he said, ""They have all been on to me,"" I naturally wondered what that meant. I have heard of a gang called the ""Forties.""

Dr. KARL ERNST SUNDEL , M.R.C.P., assistant resident physician at the London Hospital. On June 12 the boy George White was brought to me. He was suffering from a wound half an inch long and a quarter of an inch deep on the right side below the clavicle. The edges of the wound were clean cut. There was no deep structural injury. The wound had been caused by some sharp instrument—suggest a knife. There was no serious injury.

(Defence.)

ROGER HELLEN (prisoner, on oath). I am a porter in the employ of the Great Eastern Railway goods department, and have been employed by the company five years. I have never had any sort of charge made against me before. I live at 4, Bushell Street, High Street, Wapping. I know a gang of boys called the ""Forties."" There are a number of such gangs. I went out with a gang about five times. The last time I went out was about six weeks or two months ago. Prosecutor has been in the habit of going out with them. On June

11, the day before this happened, I was done work about half-past 12 in the day, and having heard from some other boys that prosecutor wanted to fight me, I went over to Stepney to look for him. I saw him surrounded by a crowd of boys. Before I could get at him one of the boys got between us and kept me away from him. one of the boys rushed across and deliberately hit me one in the mouth One of the boys produced a revolver.

The Recorder inquired how this was material. The production of the revolver would not justify the use of a knife the next day when there were no other boys there at all.

Mr. Eustace Fulton thought it might if prosecutor and the other boys had produced a state of mind in which prisoner was in fear of being attacked, but not otherwise.

The Recorder said that anything that took place on June 11 afforded no justification at all, and he would have to tell the jury that prisoner had no right to use a knife unless his life and limb were in danger; a fortiori, whatever took place on June 11, prisoner would not have the right to use a knife the next day.

Mr. Eustace Fulton. If someone pointed a revolver at him, and he had reason to think he was in danger, he would have the right to protect himself. Surely what took place the night before would be justification.

The Recorder. Certainly not.

Prisoner, further examined, admitted taking out the knife.

ARTHUR DENNIS , bootmaker, Wapping; CHARLES HAMMOND , clerk in the cartage department of the Great Eastern Railway; HERBERT JOHN LEWIS , and Mrs. HELLEN , prisoner's mother, were called as to character, and spoke to prisoner having always borne the reputation of a peaceable and respectable man.

Upon the advice of the Recorder, prisoner withdrew his plea and pleaded guilty, and the jury returned a verdict accordingly.

The Recorder remarked that so far as the jury and himself were concerned, this was an undefended case. No one in this country was allowed to use a knife with impunity; the use of the knife was not a characteristic of English people unless there was reasonable ground to believe that life and limb were in danger, in which case a man might of course defend himself.

Mr. Dennis having intimated his willingness to be bound in the sun of £10 for prisoner's good behaviour, the Recorder allowed prisoner to enter into his own recognisances in the sum of £25 to come up for judgment if called upon.

BEFORE THE COMMON SERJEANT.

(Wednesday, June 24.)"
Royal Offences,"Detective JOHN COURSE , L Division. I was with Sergeant Beard in plain clothes in Cornwall Road, Stamford Street, about one o'clock on the afternoon of June 29. I saw prisoner with two other men, one of them called English. I saw Hathaway take something from his right vest pocket and hand it to English. They walked to the top of Duke Street and Sergeant Beard and I caught hold of them. Prisoner struggled very violently and I had to throw him to the ground, and I called to the crowd which had gathered for assistance, telling them that he had got counterfeit coins. During the struggle he forced his hand down and took a handful of something that looked like money from his right vest pocket; he also had something in paper in his mouth. I forced two half-crowns out of his hand, and he scattered some among the crowd. He called out, ""Do not let him have my money; look after me, Ted."" I saw a carman pick one up and a boy another; I am sure there were five in addition to these two that I took from him; I am almost sure these are bad. I took him into custody. He said, ""I have cheated you, you f—r; I have got no counterfeit coins; you ought to have got the others; they have got them."" On the way to the station he said, ""Now, don't be wicked and I will tell you how to catch those people that do make them."" He was searched, and I found 5d. in his back trousers pocket. I afterwards found close to where the struggle took place the piece of paper now produced; it appears to be folded as if it had had money wrapped in it. When charged with having been in possession of seven counterfeit coins he said, ""Seven—I never had any""; when asked for his address he first said he had no fixed abode, then he said he lived with English, the other prisoner, and subsequently he said 77, Blackfriars Road. I went there and found he did not live there. I subsequently went to a house occupied by Mrs. Small in Ethel Street. She showed me a first-floor back room, which I searched. I found a file with metal substance on it, some lamp black in a tin, and two tins containing chalk. I also found this saucepan, which is burnt at the bottom, and in the dustbin in the yard I found a large quantity of plaster all broken up into small pieces similar to the piece I produce. Sergeant Beard gave me a piece of metal which fits exactly into the ridge at the bottom of the saucepan. The things produced are the sort of things that are used in the making of counterfeit coins.

To Prisoner. I did not rush at you with force in Stamford Street so that we both fell to the ground. When I took you to the station I did not charge you there and then. It was about one or a quarter-past when I took you to the station; it was not just after 12; you were there about an hour and a half before you were charged; possibly it was 20 minutes past four before you were put in the dock and charged. You were not charged at once because we wanted to go and find some of the coins that you had thrown away. I did go to Stamford Street and find the piece of paper I produced; it was in the gutter; that was about three-quarters of an hour afterwards. I

went to your place and searched the room at eight o'clock the same evening and found the articles I produced, the lampblack in a little dubbin tin, the chalk, the file, and so on. The lampblack was produced at the police court. I found it on the mantelpiece; this is the tin it was in; I did produce this tin at the police court. I also found the saucepan; I did not take it to the station, because I did not think it necessary at that time. The piece of metal Sergeant Beard gave me fits that saucepan. I do not know whether it would fit any other. I did search your room thoroughly; I did not find the piece of metal, there. I found the saucepan in the fender.

(Wednesday, July 22.)

Sergeant JOHN BEARD , L Division. Before the struggle in which prisoner and English were arrested, I saw the former take out of his pocket a coin which appeared to be a half-crown and hand it to another man, when Sergeant Course arrested Hathaway and I English. Subsequently on July 2 I went to 28, Ethel Street, Lambeth, and was shown into a room by the landlady, Harriett Small, and there I found in a cupboard a piece of metal with traces of plaster of paris upon it; upon the washhand stand I found some sand and was handed a piece of metal by Mrs. Small (produced). On the 4th I again attended and was handed a metal saucepan with metal adhering to it and burnt, and amongst some coal in a locked room I found a number of pieces of burnt plaster of paris, in one of which was the dove-tailed mark of a mould, so made to fix into another mould; those things I handed to Sergeant Box.

To Prisoner. I found the pieces of plaster in the locked front room, and was told you occupied the back, and that the coal had been taken from your room and put in there. The saucepan was in the fire place, and I took possession of it as evidence against you. It was probably overlooked by the detective who made the first search owing to his inexperience with regard to searching coiners' premises and not knowing what they used. The saucepan appears to have been used without water, and the metal adhering to it is similar to metal I have seen in other melting pots.

ANNIE FOSTER , wife of Henry Foster, 72, Stamford Street. At one o'clock in the day on June 29 I was sitting in the hall looking out of the door and saw the traffic stop and a crowd collect. I went out to see what was the matter and saw some person struggling with the prisoner—probably Sergeant Course. The man was on the ground and I saw him drop several coins which looked like two-shilling and half-crown pieces, but whether they were good or bad I don't know. I had my foot on one, but a boy when I moved my foot picked it up and took it away. I also saw a boy take something out of the prisoner's hand.

To Prisoner. At the police court I said that I saw a man take something out of your hand and your left-hand pocket. That was when you were got up from the ground and were being taken to the

police station, three or four officers were taking you, but I am not aware that a constable was holding you. I do not know who the man was who took the something from you.

HARRIETT SMALL , widow, 28, Ethel Street, Lambeth. I let part of my house to my daughter. I know the prisoner. About five weeks ago he and a woman, who was supposed to be his wife, and a little boy came to lodge at my house under the name of Smith; they stopped there till June 29. They occupied the first-floor back room, which was furnished. Smith frequently had callers, particularly the man English, who used to call every morning and see Smith downstairs, but more frequently he would go up to his room. I remember the police officer coming and searching the premises, and after that somebody came and asked for Mrs. Smith, and saw her. Mrs. Smith then brought some rubbish down and threw it into the dusthole, and then went out in a great hurry; after that, with the exception of a short time in the evening when she came back, I have seen nothing more of her, from which I concluded her husband was locked up. Sergeant Course came the same day and found some things amongst the ashes. On April 1 my granddaughter was sweeping Smith's room and found a piece of metal underneath the skirting near the washstand. She brought it down to me and I gave it to the police officer. There was a cupboard in the room, and I took out from it some coal and wood and put it in the lower front room, and afterwards the officer went and searched amongst that. The saucepan (produced) is my saucepan which I lent them to cook their food in. I have had it many years.

Cross-examined by Prisoner. I took the coal from your cupboard down to the front parlour to take care of it, because your missus said that you would come back later on and fetch it. The officer could not have said that he found the coal in the front room upstairs.

MARGARET LENHAM (10 years old). I am the granddaughter of the last witness and reside with her. I remember prisoner residing at my grandmother's house. Two days after Smith left I was sweeping his room and found a piece of metal under the skirting board by the washstand in the first-floor back furnished room, and the spoon (produced) on the floor.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , Inspector of Counterfeit Coins, H. M. Mint. The two coins shown to me are bad. Certain articles have been produced to me, viz., a spoon, with traces of metal adhering, evidently used for pouring metal into a mould, a piece of glass with marks of plaster upon it, and used for making moulds with, a piece of metal which seems to have fitted into some pot, a file with piece of metal upon it, some lampblack, and other articles used by coiners.

Cross-examined by Prisoner. It is almost impossible to say whether there has been molten metal in the saucepan, as there was no metal adhering to the bottom. You may not know what I mean by lampblack, which is used to give tone to the coins, and other substances may be used for the same purpose. We generally, however, in these cases find lampblack.

Verdict, Guilty."
Theft,"JOHN SCOTT . I am a porter at Messrs. Lampson's, fur merchants, 64, Queen Street, E.C.; I have been with them 25 years. They employ over 100 men, and it is my duty to provide food for them; for this purpose I frequently go to the ""King's Head"" public-house in Queen Street. I was there on June 25 between one and two in the afternoon. I saw John Rosenberg there; he said, ""Good morning"" to me; I answered him, and then he asked me how the sale was going on at my firm; I told him I knew nothing about it, and that if he wanted information he could go round and get it; he said, ""I don't want to go round, but as I am a dealer I wanted to know, so that I could buy cheap if possible."" He said, ""Could you get anything that would do yourself a bit of good?"" I said, ""Yes, at times."" He said, ""If you can get anything, fetch it round to my address,"" and he gave me a piece of paper bearing the words, ""Rosenberg, 9, Windmill Street, E. C., third floor""; he said, ""This is between you and me and the lamppost."" At this time I was dressed in a furrier's long white smock. I subsequently made a communication to our manager, Mr. Proctor. On June 29 I went to 9, Windmill Street and knocked at a door on the third floor. Harry Rosenberg same to the door. I said, ""Is Mr. Rosenberg in?"" he said, ""I am Mr. Rosenberg;"" I said, ""You don't recognise me?"" he said, ""No""; I said, ""Thames

Street""; he said, ""Oh, yes, come in."" When I got in he said, ""Well, what have you got?"" I said, ""Nothing with me, but I have got something in tow""; he said, ""When can you bring it?"" I said, ""I can't tell you; I shall have to make the best of my way with it round here."" I then left. I called and saw him again on July 1. He said, ""Have you got anything?"" I said, ""No, not here; I have got something all ready,"" and I asked him which was the best way to get it to his place; he said, ""Can't you fetch it?"" I said, ""It is rather risky for me; can't you come and meet me?"" he said, ""That would be very risky; can't you put it over a public-house bar or a booking-office at a station and let me have the ticket?"" I said, ""I will come back later on and let you know how I can distribute them."" On the morning of July 3 I took the four skins (produced) from our office and concealed them in my trousers and went to 9, Windmill Street, where I saw both prisoners. Harry said, ""Well, have you got them?"" I said, ""Yes""; I looked round and said, ""Is it all right?"" he said, ""Yes."" I then took the skins from my trousers and placed them on the bench. Both prisoners looked at them and threw them under the table. Harry said, ""How much?"" I said, ""You ought to know the price within a little""; he said, ""Five shillings?"" I said, ""No, make it more than that—make it half a sovereign""; he said, ""I'll tell you what I will do; I will make it 8s."" I said, ""Well, I must accept that""; he gave me half a sovereign in gold and I gave him four sixpences change. I then left. The detectives were at the bottom of the stairs, and they immediately went up. I accompanying them, and arrested prisoners. From June 26 I had been acting under the instructions of the police and my firm.

Cross-examined. John Rosenberg was a perfect stranger to me when he first spoke to me on June 25. Other people in the bar might have heard our conversation. He approached me first. He said, ""Good morning, how is the sale going on?"" he did not say ""at my firm""; that was a slip I made just now. I admit I could not understand a stranger asking me to have a drink, but I did not then think there was anything wrong. He did say that he was in the fur trade, and ask how trade was going. I did not say, ""If you take stuff we can shift it cheap""; he did not say, ""I am not in business on my own account, I work for my brother,"" or that he was fairly stocked up; I did not ask him for his address; he gave it me voluntarily. I am positive it was Harry I saw on July 1. At the interview of the 3rd I took the skins from my trousers in the presence of the two prisoners. It is not the fact that we agreed the price of the skins at £6, that he gave me 8s. on account, and that I was to call the next day for the balance.

ARTHUR PROCTOR , manager to Lampson and Co. On June 26 Scott made a communication to me and I communicated with the police. The four skins produced were marked and handed to Scott; their value is about £8 wholesale.

Sergeant CHARLES CHAPMAN , City Police. On July 3 I and Inspector Lyons accompanied Scott to 9, Windmill Street; I saw him go upstairs. When he came down the three of us went up to

the third floor and then saw the two prisoners. Lyons said, ""We are police officers, and I believe you have just bought some skins from this man"" (Scott). Harry Rosenberg said, ""He has brought no skins here."" Lyons said to John, ""Have you bought any skins?"" John said, ""No, he has brought no skins here."" Lyons said, ""We shall search the place""; Harry said, ""You can do as you like about that."" We then commenced the search. I went to a bench where prisoners were standing; I pushed Harry on one side and pulled a drawer under the bench, and there I found these four skins. I said, ""What do you both want to tell lies for? here are the marks,"" and I showed prisoners the marks on the skins. They were then separately told that they would be charged with stealing the furs and with inciting Scott to commit a crime. Harry said, ""Be lenient with me; I have a wife and one child, deaf and dumb; I am only a young man; be a father to me; I have never done anything wrong before, and I paid him 8s. for the lot."" John said, ""I know nothing about it."" On John being searched at the police station 9 1/2 d. was found on him; it was returned to him and he gave the receipt produced; I have compared the handwriting with that on the paper which Scott declares was handed to him by John Rosenberg on June 23, and, in my opinion, the writing is the same.

Cross-examined. I am sure that Harry said he had given ""8s. for the lot""; he was no doubt rather confused and upset. I have made inquiries as to him; he has always borne a good reputation.

(Defence.)

HARRY ROSENBERG (prisoner, on oath). I am 24 years of age; I was born in England, and have been carrying on business as a furrier for five or six years—for the last 18 months at 9, Windmill Street. My brother John works for me; I employ about seven men. On June 29 Scott called at my place and asked to see Mr. Rosenberg. I said, ""I am Mr. Rosenberg."" He said, ""You are not the Mr. Rosenberg I want."" I said, ""Perhaps you want to see my brother, but he is out at present."" He said that a few days previously he had met a Mr. Rosenberg in Thames Street, who had said he was a probable man who would take some stuff off his hands. I had no knowledge at this time that my brother had had any conversation with Scott. I said I was pretty well stocked up, but if he had anything cheap I might possibly be able to put it into stock. He said he had nothing with him then, but he would be passing in a few days and would bring some stuff to show me; he then left. Scott is quite mistaken in saying that he saw me at all on July 1; the next time I saw him was on July 3. I and my brother were together. Scott produced four skins. I asked how much he wanted for them. He said £8. I said I could not possibly give that, as I did not want them, but if he would take £6 I might be able to make use of them when the season came on. He agreed to £6. I then took the skins and put them in a drawer where I generally keep skins. I told him to call again for the money. He said he wanted it then. I said I had only 10s. in my

pocket, and that I would let him have 8s., keeping 2s. for my day's expenses. I gave him half a sovereign and he gave me 2s. change. He said he would give me a receipt when he called next day for the balance of the money. He then left, and shortly afterwards returned with three police officers. I could not imagine what had happened and, comparatively, lost my senses. This accounts for my at first denying that I had bought any furs and saying what I did to the officers. I do not think I told Chapman that I had given Scott 8s. for the lot—I said 8s. on account. When I arranged that Scott should call for the money the following day, I had in view a payment I was to receive from the Fore Street Warehouse Company; that payment was actually made. I produce a cheque from that company to me for £14 5s., dated July 4.

Cross-examined. I have never in my life had any contact with the police before this, and the arrival of the officers completely upset me. My brother had not spoken to me about his meeting with Scott until after Scott first calling on me. I keep no banking account; there is a till in my shop, and I also keep business money in my pocket. I am not in partnership with my brother. I trade as Rosenberg and Co., and my brother is in my employ at £1 a week. Scott did not tell me his name or address or what his firm was. I absolutely deny that I saw Scott at all on July 1.

JOHN ROSENBERG (prisoner, on oath). I am 22 years old, and work for my brother Harry at £1 a week. On June 25 I saw Scott in the ""King's Head."" He had on a furrier's smock, and I took him to be in the fur line. I told him I was in his line and asked him how trade was. He said it was bad, and he could not move anything, although he had a lot of stuff. He said if I could take any of his stuff he could shift it cheap. I told him that the business I was in was not my own, that I was working for my brother Harry, and that he was fairly stocked too. I did not say to Scott, ""How are the sales getting on at your firm?"" I did not know that he came from Lamson's, of that they had a sale on. I said he might pick something out and bring it along, and I gave him our address. I next saw Scott on July 3. He produced the four skins and asked £8 for them. My brother said he would give £6 and he agreed. Eventually Harry paid him 8s. on account. Harry asked for a receipt. Scott said he would give him one when he called the next morning for the balance. When the officers called I denied that any skins had been brought by Scott; the reason I did so was that I got excited.

Cross-examined. I did not get any name or address from Scott; he told me he was in business for himself. I did not mention to my brother that I had seen Scott; it slipped my memory.

LEONARD DOUST , furrier, Foster Lane, E. C., and JOSEPH BARKLE, furrier, Spitalfields, spoke to Harry Rosenberg's character as a respectable, honest man.

Verdict, Guilty. Sentence, Harry Rosenberg, 18 months' hard labour; John Rosenberg, two years' hard labour.

BEFORE MR. JUSTICE SUTTON.

(Monday, July 27.)"
Theft,"Police-constable EDWARD WIGMORE, 347 X. On July 31, about nine p.m., I was on Carlton Bridge, Westbourne Park, overlooking the Grand Junction Canal. I saw the two prisoners walking along the towing-path in the direction of Kensal Green. At 11 p.m. I saw them in Golborne Gardens. James was carrying a sack which appeared rather bulky. The two went into 4, Golborne Gardends. I and Constable Saunders kept observation on the house during the night. At eight next morning I went to the house with Saunders and Sergeant Hambrook. Prisoners were in bed asleep and we woke them up. Underneath the bed I found a large quantity og copper wire in coils. I asked James where he got it from; he said, ""You will find out—up the Green."" Between the mattress and the bed I found some more wire cut into strips and wrapped in a handkerchief.

Police-constable GEORGE SAUNDERS, 682 X, who was in company with Wigmore, confirmed the evidence of the latter, and added: I asked Thomas where he got the wire from; he said, ""The same place as he,"" pointing to James.

Detective-sergeant WALTER HAMBROOK, X Divion. I was with Wigmore and Saunders on Carlton Bridge at nine p.m. and saw prisoner; at 11 we saw them in Golborne Gardens with the sack. I left Wigmore and Saunders to keep observation on the house prisoners had entered. I went back to the towing-path and found that a lot of telegraph wire had been cut down from the poles. Next morning I went with the two constables to the house and saw them take the wire from under the bed and from between the mattress and the bed. I also found a hatchet which had apparently been used for cutting up the wire.

THOMAS GRANT , lineman, G.P.O. Telegraph Service. I identify the wire produced as the property of the Postmaster-General. On July 31, at six p.m., I tested the lines along the Grand Junction Canal and everything was right. Next morning I found there was interruption, and on tracing it I found that a quantity of wire had been cut from the poles.

ARTHUR HENRY WOOD , engineer in the P.O. Telegraph Service, said that the wire produced weighed 21 lb.; it was about 300 yards. Its value was about 25s. The total wire cut on the night in question was 480 yards. The line affected was one of the most important trunk lines in the kingdom.

Verdict, Thomas Harrigan, Guilty. Previous convictions were proved against James.

Sentence: James, Three years' penal servitude; Thomas, six months' hard labour. The police officers were commended for their conduct of the case."
Theft,"ELY MARSHALL , general manager of Marshalls, Limited, perfumers, 46, Colebrooke Row, Islington. Taylor and Cope were in our employment. On October 3 the police brought to me the articles produced (toilet-books and papers, etc.), which I identify as the property of the firm, value £2 or £3.

To Mr. Fox Davies. Goods partly damaged are sometimes described as ""throw-outs."" I will not say that it requires an expert to distinguish between damaged first-class goods and original second-class goods. The public are pretty clever at discriminating.

Sergeant ERNEST HAIG, N Division. On September 4, in company with Inspector Ball, I went to 14, Baldwin Street, where I saw Simpson. I said, ""We are police officers; we are making inquiry concerning some paper books which it is alleged that you obtained from some people working at Messrs. Marshalls, of Cole-brooke Row, and passed on to your uncle. She said, ""I know nothing at all about it; I do not know the person you refer to? I told her I was not satisfied, and we took her to Islington Police Station in a cab. On the way she said, ""The truth is the best, I suppose. I know Taylor, and I have had some books and papers from her, and passed them on to my uncle. He has had all I have had, and he has also had some lanoline."" At the station she made no reply to the charge.

To Mr. Burnie. She was not excited at the visit of the police officers; I thought she was rather selfpossessed.

Inspector ALFRED BALL, K Division. On September 4, at 8 a.m., I, with other officers, went to 152, Armagh Road, Bow. We found Bignell in bed. I said, ""We are police officers. I have reason to

believe that you have stolen property on your premises, and I am going to search the house."" He said, ""Very well, guv'nor, you are welcome to do it; you will find nothing here."" In a back room on the first floor I found the books and papers produced. I asked Bignell where he got the property from. He said, ""I bought it as job-lots in the Caledonian Market."" I said, ""From whom?"" He said, ""You know I can't tell you that; we never notice a man much who is selling on the stones.... I took no receipt. ""I took him to the police-station, and he was detained. In the evening, after the other prisoners had been arrested, I talked to Bignell again. I said, ""I have made inquiries concerning the books and papers I took this morning, and find that they were stolen from Marshalls, perfumers, of Islington, by two of their girls, Taylor and Cope, who passed them over to your niece, Daisy Simpson, and I shall charge you with receiving stolen goods."" He said, ""Very well."" When afterwards charged with the girls, he said, ""Thats all right, but I did not know they were stolen.""

To Mr. Fox Davies. At Caledonian Market all kinds of waste property is sold. From my inquiries, I find that Bignell has been a frequenter of the market; he has been selling these books there. When I searched his premises and found this property it was not covered up at all, and there were with it a lot of toys and other stuff, such as might be sold in the Caledonian Market.

Statements before the Magistrate. Simpson: ""I did not know they were stolen; I thought they were throw-outs."" Bignell: ""I did not know they were stolen.""

Verdict. Simpson, Not guilty; Bignell, Guilty. The indictment of Bignell for receiving a ring was not proceeded with. He confessed to a conviction at this Court, on February 9, 1903, of receiving stolen property.

The police gave Bignell a very bad character; he is a noted receiver of property the proceeds of burglaries and the constant associate of some of the cleverest housebreakers and burglars. Taylor and Cope bear a good general character. Bignell was sentenced to four years' penal servitude; Taylor and Cope were released on their own recognisances, each in the sum of £20, to come up for judgment if called upon."
Theft,"Dr. STEPHEN HENRY BATES, 11, Archway Road, Highgate. I have no knowledge whatever of the prisoner. On September 30 I received a letter addressed to ""Surgeon S. H. Bates,"" from Rowton House, Newington Butts, saying: ""Sir,—If you do not send me £500 I will write to the newspapers all about the

illegal operations you perform and will be your ruin.... I will not trouble you any more if you send what I ask you; I will leave the country at once; so do not forget to send if you want to save all trouble.—G. Sims."" I at once gave the letter to the police. On October 2 I received a further letter saying, ""If you do not send me the money on Saturday I shall come to Highgate and do something to your place or to you; if I get the £500 I shall keep my mouth shut."" I handed this letter also to the police.

Inspector FRANK WHITE, X Division. On October 3 I, with another officer, saw prisoner in Cornwall Road, Lambeth. I said, ""We are police officers and shall arrest you for sending to Dr. Bates, of 11, Archway Road, Highgate, and a number of other persons, letters demanding money by menaces."" He said, ""I don't know anything about it."" I took him to the station and there showed him the two letters and read them to him. I said, ""These have been identified as being in your handwriting, and you will be charged."" He said, ""It's no use denying it; I did write them; I can't think what made me do it, but I can't help it; I have not lived at Rowton House; I put that address as I thought it would be a better place to receive replies; I have been there two or three times and looked at the list, but could not see any letters for me; I got the names and addresses from the directories."" On being formally charged he made no reply. Detective JOHN HENDRY, C. I. D. I know prisoner, and have seen him write. To the best of my belief these two letters are in his writing.

To Prisoner. It was in Pentonville Prison that I saw you write.

Prisoner declined to go into the box or to make any statement.

Verdict, Guilty.

It was stated that there were other similar charges which would not now be pressed; several previous convictions were proved. The question had arisen whether prisoner was responsible for his actions, but a doctor who had examined him came to the conclusion that he was responsible.

Mr. Justice Bigham, remarking that this was an offence which must be put a stop to, sentenced prisoner to Seven years' penal servitude."
Killing,"ADA TATTERSALL . I live with my aunt, Mrs. Worth, at 26, Stanford Road, Kensington. From April to October prisoner was employed there as parlourmaid. About the end of September my suspicions were aroused at to her physical condition, and I asked her to see a doctor; she said she would do so when her aunt came home. On September 25 I insisted that she should see our own doctor; the next day prisoner gave a month's notice to leave. On the morning of October 2 I noticed that she had not come downstairs, and I called for her; she came down about eight. I then had a conversation with the cook. About nine I saw prisoner in the kitchen; she looked very ill. I induced her to go upstairs to bed and I went for a doctor. Before doing so I went to her room, where I saw a utensil full of blood; the water in the wash-basin was bloodstained and a towel and some clothing were stained also. I saw prisoner after the doctor had examined her. She said, ""The doctor says I am going to have a baby and says I must go to the infirmary; instead of that I will go to my mother."" A short time afterwards she went with the cook in a cab to the infirmary; the tin box and black wooden box produced went with her. After her departure I again went to her bedroom, and found a sheet saturated with blood rolled up and put under the bolster; there was blood on the carpet end bloodstained things about the room.

ELEANOR EARWAKER . I was cook at Mrs. Worth's, where prisoner was parlourmaid; we slept in the same bedroom, in different beds. In August she began to complain of indigestion and sickness. On the night of October 1 I noticed that she had got out of bed in the middle of the night. I asked her what she was doing, and she said she was going to. the lavatory; she left the room. I went to sleep again and did not hear her return. About quarter to seven next morning the called out to me from her bed that it was time to get

up. On getting up I noticed that the chamber utensil was covered over with a towel. Just before eight she came down to the kitchen. She said, ""Would I take up the tea to the mistress, as she was very poorly."" She was standing by the kitchen table, and I noticed there was blood on the floor. At 20 past eight I saw her in the bedroom; she was washing herself. She said she was in an awful state. I noticed that the bedclothes were bloodstained. She said she had had some pains and had taken salts to make her better. Later in the morning, after the doctor had seen her, I went to her by Miss Tattersall's directions, and said she was to get up and dress, and I would pack her boxes, and she was to go home. She started packing her tin box and a black wooden box which I lent her (as a box of hers was under repair). When I went to help her pack the tin box was almost full; I put a few small things on the top; I locked that box and also the black box and prisoner took the keys. Finally, I went with prisoner and the boxes in a cab to the Relieving Officer and then to the infirmary.

Cross-examined. I had no suspicion until the end that anything was wrong with the prisoner. She frequently spoke to me about her parents in Gloucestershire. On the day she went into the infirmary I wrote to her mother telling her of the circumstances, going by what prisoner had told me that morning. I told the mother that the doctor said he thought prisoner was about four months' gone; I was then under the belief that the child was still to come.

CHARLES EWART , M.D., 58, Queen's Gate Terrace. On October 2, about 9.30 a.m., I saw prisoner in her bedroom at 26, Stanford Road and examined her, externally only, and came to the conclusion that she was about four months in pregnancy. I told her she was in the family way. She said she knew nothing of it. I said, ""To be in this condition you must know about it."" She said, ""If he has done it to me I did not know about it."" I suggested that she should go to the infirmary, as she could not be properly treated in the house. She replied that she wanted to go to her home in Gloucestershire. I said she was not in a fit condition to do that. On October 5 I assisted Dr. Potter in a post-mortem examination.

Cross-examined. I have had a great deal of experience in child delivery. Even a healthy married woman at such a time would be in a state of mental excitement; a respectable, but unmarried, young woman, in great agony, suddenly discovering that she was about to become a mother would be even more likely to be affected in her mind.

HENRY PERCY POTTER , F.R.C.S., medical superintendent at Kensington Infirmary. On October 5 I examined the dead body of a female child; it was a full-term child; it had an incised wound across the throat, 2 1/2 in. long, extending right through the windpipe, severing the blood vessels of the neck; there was a fracture of the left collar bone and of the right side of the lower jaw, a large contusion below the right ear, a punctured wound over the heart; two ribs were fractured and a third injured. The punctured wound might have been inflicted with the scissors produced; they could

not have caused the cut at the throat. There were other punctured wounds on the body. I should say the child had breathed for at least three or four minutes; it had certainly had a separate existence. The cause of death was hemorrhage from the cut throat; that wound must have been inflicted during life. On the scissors were traces of mammalian blood. I was shown by the police some pills; they tasted strongly of aloes, and were of such a nature as to be likely to cause abortion.

Cross-examined. A woman delivering herself, and cutting the cord with scissors would no doubt have a shaky hand; this may account for some of the punctured wounds, but others appear to me to indicate some deliberation and decision.

HERBERT CAMPION , relieving officer, Kensington, proved the admission of prisoner to the infirmary.

HENRY HAWKINS , porter at the infirmary, said that the two boxes produced came with prisoner in the cab and were deposited in the receiving ward waiting room.

ADA SUTTON , wardswoman at the infirmary. On October 2 I received prisoner; from my examination of her I concluded she had just been delivered of a child, and I had her taken to the maternity ward. She gave me a small hand-bag; it contained some coins and some keys. I saw the two boxes in the waiting-room. On October 5 I noticed a faint smell from them. I got the keys from prisoner's bag and I opened the tin box; I found wrapped in the clothes (produced) the dead body of a female child.

JOHN MUGGLESTON , M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P., assistant medical officer, Kensington Infirmary. On October 2, at 11 a.m., I examined prisoner and found she had just been delivered of a child; I asked her where the child was; she said there had been no child, only clots.

Sergeant GEORGE VERNEY, F Division. On October 10 I was shown at Kensington Infirmary the dead body of a child, wrapped in the clothes identified by Sutton. I searched the boxes produced. In the tin box I found the small pair of scissors and stiletto produced; in the wooden box I found this other pair of scissors; they were lying about the middle of the box, as if they bad been thrown in and the clothes thrown on top of them; there were what appeared to be bloodstains on the scissors. I also found the box of pills produced. I handed the articles to Dr. Potter.

Inspector THOMAS TAPPENDEN , F Division. On October 26, at Kensington Police Station, I charged prisoner with ""the wilful murder of her newly-born female child, on October 2, at 26, Stanford Street""; she replied, ""Yes, I understand; I put the child in the box; it was born while I was on the bed, and I wrapped it up in my clohtes."" On November 2, at West London Police Court, prisoner volunteered to me this statement: ""The child was born after Earwaker had gone upstairs; I tore it from me and put it in the box.""

FREDERICK HARDING , father of prisoner (called by Mr. Cohen). I am an insurance agent, living in Gloucestershire. My daughter left home to go to London two years ago; she was then about 19 years old. She has been well educated; she has taught in Sunday school,

and was always a girl of very good character. She frequently wrote to her mother, and knew that our home was always open to her. When we got the letter from Earwaker we thought the child was yet to come, and my wife wrote to Earwaker to know when Ethel would be able to come home.

Verdict, ""Guilty, with the strongest possible recommendation to mercy, as we consider that she was in a frenzied state of mind at the time the act was committed.""

Mr. Herman Cohen submitted that this was a verdict of Guilty, but insane.

Mr. Justice Bigham said he thought it was a verdict of Guilty, and he must act upon it. Addressing the prisoner, he desired her not to be anxious, because he hoped and believed that the recommendation of the jury (to which his own would be added) would be received with sympathy, and would be given effect to by the Home Secretary, to whom it would be forwarded. He was, however, obliged to pass upon her the only sentence which was permissible for the crime of which she had been found guilty—namely, the sentence of death."
Royal Offences,"Detective-sergeant CHARLES CRUTCHETT , T Division. On November 26 I went to 8, Harris Cottages, Worton Road, Isleworth (occupied by prisoner), in company with two other officers at about 12 o'clock in the day time. The house was locked up. We gained admission to it. It consisted of two rooms, one downstairs and one up. In the lower room I found the butcher's knife (produced) with plaster of Paris on it, a paper containing white metal, and a small packet bound round with wire containing four pieces of antimony. Two moulds bearing the impression of a shilling were handed to me by the other officers, and 22 counterfeit shillings, some plaster of Paris, two pieces of white metal, an iron ladle containing dross, an old string bag, some broken plaster and a file. I was present when prisoner was charged. He made no reply.

Detective HENRY MULLINS , T Division. On November 26 I was in company with last witness and Sergeant Charles at the house occupied by the prisoner. In the downstair room on the dresser I found a small three-cornered file which had apparently been used with white metal. On searching the coal cupboard under the stairs I found two moulds with the impress of both sides of a shilling, bearing date 1907. Behind the moulds, wrapped up in a piece of newspaper, I found 22 unfinished base shillings. Hanging on the wall was an old string bag, inside which was a ladle containing dross metal.

Detective-sergeant ROBERT CHARLES , T Division. In the downstair room I found a brown paper parcel containing a quantity of unused plaster of Paris and two small pieces of white metal. These articles were on the top shelf in the cupboard covered over with a quantity of old newspapers. In the grate, where there had been a fire, I found some pieces of broken plaster of Paris.

HENRY HARRIS , house and estate agent, Twickenham Road, Isleworth, spoke to collecting rent from prisoner, the occupier of No. 8, Harris Cottages. Prisoner had been in occupation about five months and the rent was 4s. per week. Prisoner lived there with his two sons, lads of 12 and 10 years, and there was no other occupier or lodger.

Police-constable WILLIAM KIND, 368 T. I arrested prisoner on November 25. I searched him at the police station and found upon him seven sixpences and 1s. 9d. in bronze.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , Inspector of Coins at the Mint, said the moulds produced were single moulds for a shilling of the date of 1907. The 22 counterfeit shillings produced were roughly cast and in an unfinished state; nine were from one mould and 13 from another. There was plaster of Paris attached to the knife produced. There was the remainder of molten metal in the ladle and some fresh plaster of Paris was produced. Amongst the white metal were four pieces of antimony, used with a small proportion of copper in the making of base coin. There was no impression of a coin on the fragments of moulds found in the fire place.

Verdict, Guilty.

Detective MULLINS said he had known prisoner about eight years. Since he had been living at Harris Cottages he had mixed with coiners, and his next-door neighbour was now awaiting trial at the Middlesex Sessions for the same kind of offence. Prisoner was arrested for uttering, being in company with this other man, but, there not being sufficient evidence, he was discharged, and it was while he was in custody that his house was searched. There had previously been complaints to the police that a number of base coins were being uttered in the district, and it was probable that coins had been supplied to prisoner by those who had more to do with coining than prisoner himself had.

Sentence, 12 months' hard labour."
Violent Theft,"ANTON OLLIKKA . ship's fireman. I am a Finn. On November 17, 1908. I was paid off from my ship and went to the Scandinavian

Home, Poplar. On the 18th I got there after 12 p.m., too late to to admitted, and went down West India Dock Road looking for a place to sleep. In Three Colts Street I met a young woman, who took me into a house, which I did not like the look of, and I left there in about 10 minutes. I had then between 18s. and 19s. in my trousers' pocket. After walking about a minute along the street I saw two men running behind me with a third man. The prisoner was in front. He shouted after me. I stopped to look round. Prisoner came up and struck me in the face and behind the ear, knocking me down. They took all my money. A policeman came up. My trouser pocket was torn. Prisoner said to the others, ""Come on, I have got it,"" and ran away. My head was cut and was dressed by the doctor.

Cross-examined. Only one man hit me. When paid off I drew over £4. I paid an old debt; when I went out on November 18 I had about £2, bought some things, had two glasses of beer—a few drinks—five or six; I had been in four or five public-houses; I cannot say how many drinks I had had. I was a little drunk—not much. This happened between one and two a.m. The night was a bit dark. I had not seen any of the men before. When I left the house I had a half-sovereign and eight or nine shillings in silver. I did not give the woman anything. Prisoner had no overcoat on.

Re-examined. Prisoner is the man who knocked me down. (To the Recorder. I saw prisoner sitting down in the police station, 10 minutes after I was attacked, and recognised him.

Police-constable GEORGE REED , 880 K. On the early morning of November 19 I, with Police-constable 381 K, was on duty in Three Colts Street, when I saw prisoner, two other men, and a woman together at the bottom of Three Colts Court. Shortly afterwards two women came out of the court and spoke to them. Prosecutor had previously gone alone out of the court, walking up Three Colts Street towards Commercial Road. Prisoner and the other men followed in the same direction. I and Police-constable 381 followed, thinking there was something wrong. We got within 40 yards of the prisoner, when we saw them strike prosecutor, knock him down, stoop over him, and apparently rifle his pockets. We ran up. When we were within five or 10 yards the two others ran away down Three Colts Court; prisoner started to run up Three Colts Street. When the others shouted, ""This way,"" and prisoner followed them. We blew our whistles, followed within five or six yards, without losing sight of the prisoner. He was stopped by police-constable Kent, 652 K, in Gill Street, as they were running out of the court, and taken to the station. Prisoner is 6 ft. 0 1/2 in. in height. We never lost sight of prisoner. He had no overcoat on.

Cross-examined. We did not see prisoner pass anything to the other men. If he had done so I should have seen it; I never lost sight of them.

Re-examined. I saw prisoner and the other two rifling the prosecutor's pockets. I did not see who got the money.

Police-constable KNIBBS, 381 K. About 1.45 a.m. on November 19 I was with Police-constable 880 K in Three Colts Street, when I

saw two men and a woman talking at the top of Three Colts Court. Prosecutor came out of the court and proceeded up Three Colts Street towards Commercial Road. Two women then came out of the court and spoke to the men, who went after prosecutor. Prisoner was one of them. Thinking there was something amiss, 880 K and myself followed up Three Colts Street. When near the Limehouse Church Institute I saw prosecutor on the ground, the three bending over him, rifling his pockets, and then running away. The other two ran down Bell Alley. Prisoner was going past, when the others called out, ""This way."" He then turned and followed them. We blew our whistles, followed, and found prisoner in the custody of Police-constable Kent at the end of the alley. I returned to prosecutor, whom I found lying on the ground with a cut on his head; he went to the station with me. Prisoner had no overcoat on; one of the others had. I never lost sight of prisoner.

Cross-examined. I was five or six yards from the three men as they ran. When they started running they were 40 yards off or more. It was dark, but the street was well lit with electric lamps.

Police-constable THOMAS KENT , 652 K. In the early morning of November 19 I was on duty in Gill Street, when I heard a police whistle, and running in the direction of the sound I saw prisoner and another man rush out of Fire Bell Alley. I stopped the prisoner. He said, ""It was not me who did it—I have only just left Wally Rutland."" I had said nothing to him. I took prisoner to the station.

Cross-examined. Prisoner had no money upon him. I did not see the robbery.

Prisoner's statement before magistrate. ""Last Saturday evening I was at Wally Rutland's house with his wife. About 12.30 I said I would go home, and he came along with me to Three Colts Street. At the corner of Three Colts Court, I said, 'I will leave you now.' Then a man walked out of the court and passed me; three or four minutes afterwards another man came running down and went up Three Colts Street. I wished my friends 'Good night,' then trotted off home. I saw two men fighting; one knocked the other down; I called the man a coward; he ran down the court. I rushed after him and heard a police whistle, when a police-constable caught hold of me. When I was charged, I said, 'I know nothing about it.' The prosecutor said I had his money, but they found none on me.""

(Defence.)

CHARLES HILL (prisoner, on oath). I am 24 years of age. I have never been in trouble for any serious crime. Four years ago I was fined five shillings for being drunk. I am a dock labourer, and was doing that work on the day I was arrested. I work four or five days a week, according as I get work on a ship, sometimes all day and night. On November 18 I was at Wally Rutland's house all the evening. I cannot remember the name of the street where he lives. About 12.30 I left him, and was going towards home. He and his missis came with me as far as Three Colts Court. I shook hands with them, aid was running home when I saw prosecutor and another

man outside the public-house fighting. The other man was using obscene language, which drew my attention to them. The other man knocked prosecutor down. Seeing prosecutor was drunk, I said, ""What do you want to knock the man down like that for? Oh, you coward."" He said, ""What is that to do with you?"" and rushed at me and then ran down the court. He did not hurt me. I then heard a police whistle and ran after him. (To the Recorder.) I did not pick up the injured man. When I got to the bottom of the court, Policeconstable Kent caught hold of me. The other man went round the corner. Another constable came up and said something to Kent. He took me to the station and charged me with knocking a man down and robbing him. The prosecutor came into the station, looked at me, and said nothing. One of the constables whispered to him and he said, ""That is the man."" I asked the inspector what I was there for and prosecutor said, ""I charge this man with knocking me down and robbing me."" I live at 16, Peer Street, Stepney, my father's house, half an hour's walk from Colt Street. I am single. My father works for Richardson's, the iron people. When prosecutor charged me I said it was not me. I was then searched, nothing was found on me, and I was taken to the cells.

Cross-examined. My name is Charles Hill. Linaski is supposed to be my father's name, but I understand he was married twice; he is known as Linaski. I have always gone by the name of Charles Hill. I have worked for the New Zealand Shipping Company. I did not give their name to the police, because I thought if they went there to make inquiries it would stop my getting work. I last worked for that company three months ago. I have since worked for my father, who is foreman at Richardson's, the iron people. I know Luke Osborn. He was not with me on November 18. He has been convicted. He was not assisting me in this—I did nothing at all—he was not there that I know of. He was not one of the men I was speaking to with Rutland. I left Osborn when I was going to Rutland's house. I first spoke of seeing the men fighting when I came up on remand. The two policemen in uniform were standing there when I wished Rutland ""Good night."" They were not following me when I saw the prosecutor Knocked down. I heard the whistle and ran to catch the other man. The police-constables mistook me for the other man.

Re-examined. I ran after the other man; he struck me.

Verdict, Guilty. Sentence, 12 months' hard labour."
Breaking Peace,"ALEXANDER WILLIAM JOHN SUTHERLAND , 169, Farringdon Road Buildings, commission agent. On October 14 last, about half-past 10 to 11 p.m., I was with others in ""The Grapes"" public-house. Prisoner came in; I asked him to have a drink; and he punched one Driscoll✗, who punched him back. I said, ""Don't have a row inside; come outside."" When we got outside we were talking about fighting and prisoner punched me on the jaw. I went down on my knees and

was just getting up when I felt another punch and saw Lee's hand coming away from my back, and felt something warm running down me, and somebody said, ""Stop that. Jack!"" I began to run towards the public-house and a man pulled a knife out of my back. I entered the public-house and got a jug. Lee was running away. I caught him and struck him over the head with the jug, which broke, wounding his face. I had seen Lee handling the knife when in the public-house. I saw the knife in his hand immediately before the dispute occurred. I was taken to the Charing Cross Hospital, where I remained four weeks and a day. I had previously known the prisoner.

Cross-examined. I am a turf commission agent and sometimes back horses. That was my only occupation at the time of assault. I have been several times in trouble. I have had 18 months for stealing. A few weeks ago I was charged with being drunk and disorderly. I am not ""the terror of the West End."" The discussion in the public-house had no reference to any crime. I did not kick at prisoner. I did some boxing some years ago. When I got outside I did not strike prisoner with something sharp under the eye. He was not knocked down. I know that the prisoner was struck and kicked outside the hospital. I did not make any charge against him. The police came to me about three weeks afterwards. I had a discussion with the witness Sullivan because he asked people to say different things in prisoner's favour.

Re-examined. I got the jug because I had been stabbed and was afraid Lee was about to stab me again.

JOSEPH BLAND , billiard-marker, 3, Bateman Street, Soho. On October 14 I was in ""The Grapes"" public-house drinking with five or six others. Lee was there and Sutherland. Suddenly there was an argument; nothing to do with me. We went outside. There were a few more words outside and Lee struck Sutherland in the face. He reeled, pulled himself together and said, ""All right."" I tried to stop the row, I looked round for somebody else to stop it. Then I saw Sutherland getting up from a stooping position and as he stood upright I saw a knife sticking in his back. On impulse I pulled it out. I had had one or two drinks, but was sober.

Cross-examined. After the stabbing I saw Sutherland going in the direction which I believe Lee took. As I turned round into Shaftesbury Avenue I heard a crash, and I saw Lee crossing the road with his face streaming with blood; and I caught hold of him.

JOHN SULLIVAN , printer, 15, Seaton Street. On the night of October 14 I was having a drink with Sutherland in ""The Grapes."" Lee came in afterwards. Lee flicked on the ear with his fingers a man named Driscoll. Driscoll struck Lee, knocking him down against the wall. I left. They followed me out and I walked away. Next I saw Lee running past me in the street, Sullivan behind him with a jug in his hand. Two or three hours before I had seen Lee with a knife in the public-house. I found Sutherland in Shaftesbury Avenue and took him to the hospital.

Cross-examined. Lee had been cutting tobacco.

Mrs. ELIZABETH FORT , 6, George Street, Soho. About 11 p.m. on October 14 I was looking out of my window. A lamp faces my house and there is another 30 yards away towards ""The Grapes"" public-house. I saw some men come out of ""The Grapes"" and start to quarrel. A tall man knocked down a short one, and struck him in the back as he got up. The short man went into the public-house and came out with something white in his hand, and ran after the man who had struck him. I saw no more. I should say the short man was Sutherland, whom I had known only as frequenting the street where I live. I do not know Lee.

Cross-examined. Before the magistrate I mentioned only one blow received by Sutherland. I have not spoken to Sutherland about my evidence. I have to be in his company.

WILLIAM STEPHEN FENWICK , house surgeon at the Charing Cross Hospital. Sutherland had a wound three-quarters of an inch in length on the left-hand side of the back, at the vertebral border of the shoulder-blade bone, over the fifth rib. The wound went downwards and inwards for a depth of from 3 to 3 1/2 inches. Symptoms developed which proved that the instrument used had penetrated the pleural cavity and the lung itself, blood having collected in the cavity. About two days after the injury he commenced to spit blood. I concluded that the instrument had possibly been used by someone striking in a downward and forward direction, undoubtedly with a knife.

At this stage the prisoner pleaded guilty of unlawfully wounding, and a verdict was returned accordingly.

Prisoner was released on his own recognisances in £5 to come up for judgment if called upon.

BEFORE THE RECORDER

(Wednesday, December 9.)"
Breaking Peace,"LIZZIE DYE . I was married to prisoner nine years ago; we have not lived happily together; he has ill-treated me, punching and kicking

me. In June, 1907, I left him because I was in fear of my life. In August I lived with him again, until May last, when on account of his ill-treatment I left him again, taking a situation at Charlton. On December 10 he came to the house at Charlton where I was, at the back door, at eight in the morning. I told him that I wished to have nothing more to do with him, that the people were in the house then, and that if he must come he had better call later when they were out. He called again at four o'clock and I let him into the kitchen; Mrs. Chilcott was in the scullery working; I had told her that I was afraid of prisoner and asked her to stay. (Prisoner began swearing and accused me of immorality. Mrs. Chilcott said, ""Don't come here worrying her; she is working here, and you ought not to say such things."" I made him some tea and gave him the dinner that had been left for me. He kept asking me if I would go outside: I felt so nervous that I would not go. He asked me for money; I said, ""I have only a few coppers, will you go away quietly if I give them to you?"" He said, ""Yes""; I went upstairs and brought down 4d. and gave it to him. Then he said, ""Come outside; I want to say something to you and I have got something for you. ""I said, ""What you want to say, say here; my people will soon be home, ""He said, ""I don't care if they do come home; you had no character before you came here, and they shall know what you are. ""Finally he said, ""Kiss me goodbye before I go ""; I would not go near him to kiss him at first, but Mrs. Chilcott said, ""Oh, kiss him, and maybe he will go."" I got up to kiss him; he put his right arm round my neck; he put his left hand in his pocket and took out a razor and said, ""This is what I have got for you. ""I broke away and got to the other tide of the room; Chilcott shouted,"" Oh, don't. Police! murder!"" and I started screaming. He opened the razor and came over to me. I held his wrists with both hands and tried to bite his wrists; he punched me in the face; I think we both fell; in the scuffle the razor dropped; 'he picked' it up and put it towards my face; I snatched at the razor and it dropped again and I heard it snap. Getting free for a moment, I flew out of the room and into the next house; there I fainted and the police were sent for. My fingers were cut in snatching at the razor; I was attended by the divisional surgeon.

Cross-examined. I twice charged prisoner with assaulting me; first in November, 1904; I withdrew the summons and a deed of separation was entered into. The same thing happened in 1907. I was in fear of my life, but I went to live with prisoner again for the sake of my little children. After I finally left him and went to Charlton I continued corresponding with him; that was in order that I might hear of my children. I have no affection for him, only he is the father of my children. The reason I saw him when he called at Charlton was that the people I was with thought I was a single woman, and I was afraid if he made a bother I should lose my situation. I am certain that prisoner took the razor out of his jacket pocket; I am sure it did not fall out as he was doing up his boots. I deny that it was a pure accident arising from the struggle between prisoner and me for the possession of the razor.

ANNIE CHILCOTT , charwoman, 131, Victoria Road, Charlton. I remember prisoner coming to the house on December 10. Coming from the scullery into the kitchen I saw him sitting there with his wife. She asked him to go, as the was afraid of getting into trouble with the people coming in. He said, ""All right,"" but the did not go I said, ""Why don't you go and not come here worrying your wife? she has to work hard here."" He asked her for money; she gave him 4d.; he still would not go. He asked her to go with him to the back door as he wanted to speak to her alone; she said, ""No; what you have got to say, say here."" He said, ""I am going away to-morrow morning, kiss me goodbye before I go ""; she would not go at first, but eventually she went to kiss him. He put his right arm round her neck, and with the other he drew a razor from his pocket; she screamed and commenced struggling; I ran into the street calling for the police. On returning after five minutes I saw prisoner letting himself out of the back door; the kitchen was in great disorder.

Cross-examined. Prosecutrix appeared to ""be frightened of prisoner and very nervous of him; they were rowing together. I did not think he came there to murder her. I am certain I saw him take the razor out of his pocket. It was not an accident.

PETER COOPER , divisional surgeon, Blackheath, said that on December 10 he saw Mrs. Dye; she was suffering from an incised wound on the little finger of her left hand, and some superficial scratches on the other fingers; the wounds were consistent with cuts by the razor produced. Prisoner also had cuts on his left hand.

Police-constable JOSEPH HAINES, 64 R, spoke to finding the razor produced in the kitchen; the blade was under the table and the handle some distance away.

Sergeant JAMES WILSON, R Division. On the night of December 10 I arrested prisoner for (as I told him) the attempted murder of his wife. He said, ""My wife—where is she? Ah, she has ruined me; she gave me the bad disorder some time ago."" On being searched I found on prisoner 2d.; he said, ""That is 2d. I have got left out of the 4d. my wife gave me."" In reply to the formal charge prisoner said, ""You ought to have the men who has caused the trouble, her uncle; he knows as much about it as I do. ""

(Defence.)

WILLIAM CHARLES DYE (prisoner, on oath). I am a bricklayer; I have three children; they are with my mother at Portsmouth. On December 10 I went to see my wife at 131, Victoria Road, Charlton. I had been there every day for a week before that. I rang the bell at the back door as I had done before. She opened the door and said, ""All right, come inside""; I went in and she locked the door inside in case her mistress should come home. Mrs. Chilcott came in from he scullery, and the three of us sat down in the kitchen and had tea. My wife was nagging me the whole time. I got up to go, and asked her to unlock the door to let me out; my bootlace came undone, and in stooping down to do it up the razor fell out of my jacket pocket;

I went to pick it up; as we had been nagging all the time I suppose she thought I meant to do her some harm; the pulled the razor from me and the handle broke off; I cut my hand and she cut hers. I am fond of my wife and had no intention of injuring her at all.

Cross-examined. Chilcott had gone into the scullery at the time the razor dropped; when the came back my wife and I were struggling together on the floor. Chilcott's story that the saw me take the razor from my pocket is untrue; this it all made up for me. We had been nagging about the children; I told my wife the could not be much of a mother to go away and leave the children. Two of the children are with my mother, but I keep them; a third child it kept, not by my wife, but by her supposed uncle; it it true that yesterday my mother sent back the other two children to my wife.

Verdict, Guilty of wounding with intent to murder.

Inspector BAXTER, R Division, gave a very bad account of prisoner; he had induced his wife to go upon the streets at Portsmouth, and had lived on the proceeds of her prostitution.

Sentence, Five years' penal servitude.

At prisoner was taken from the dock be shouted to his wife, ""I will do fifteen for you when I comes out."""
Theft,"ARTHUR HENRY DREW . I am now assistant to Attenborough, 27, Buckingham Palace Road, pawnbroker, and was employed up to December 31, 1908, by R. J. Stirling, 61, Great Portland Street, pawnbroker. On December 18 McLoughlin came to 61, Great Portland Street and asked to see a half-hoop ring marked £21 which was in the window; it was shown to him by the assistant manager, Mr. Novelli, in my presence; prisoner asked us to put it aside for his wife to see it the next day. On the next day he came alone in the evening and said he had changed his mind about the half-hoop ring, but would like to see a marquise ring. I showed him one on a card; he did not like that, and asked to see the tray. I then showed him a tray containing 20 marquise, half-hoop, and single stone rings, value over £400. While he was looking at the tray another man came in who had left a ring a few days previously to be altered in size, and stood by McLoughlin. McLoughlin then asked to see a certain ring on the tray. I took the ring off with one hand; he then snatched the tray and ran out of the shop; he was much nearer the door than myself. Three of the rings fell on the floor and he carried off the remaining 23 rings of the value of £352. I immediately reported to the police and gave a description of McLoughlin and three other men. McLoughlin was ten minutes in the shop on the first day. December 18. Last Friday morning, January 8, 1909, I picked McLoughlin out from eight other men at the Mansion House Police Court. The other assistant went with me but could not identify him; he had not the same opportunity of seeing him as I had; he only had a side view from the end of the shop. On Monday I gave evidence against McLoughlin at Marlborough Street Police Court, when I saw the prisoner Pender in the beck of the court, apparently hearing the case, and I identified him as a man who was outside the shop and who had misdirected me; when I ran out after McLoughlin Pender got

in my way and told me McLoughlin had gone down a side street, which I ran down and failed to find him in. I had also seen Pender looking in the shop door several times in the afternoon of December 19. When I returned, not finding McLaughlin, Pender asked me if I had found him. I said, ""No."" He said, ""What an extraordinary thing."" I identify Pender now as far as it is possible to identify him; the man who was outside the shop had a moustache; Pender has none; of course I did not see very much of the man.

Cross-examined by McLoughlin. I said at the police court that, in addition to the man who had come for a ring left to be repaired, a third man had come in and stood at the door, that I had called out"" Hold him,"" and that the third man remained, and afterwards purchased a ring for 2s., while I had run out after the man I identify as McLoughlin; that Pender had said the man ran down a side street. I did not know McLoughlin's name. (To Mr. Huntly Jenkins.) In connection with this robbery there were three men in the shop and one outside. I did not pay so much attention to the man outside as I did to McLoughlin. The man outside had a dark moustache and a hat on. When I identified Pender at the back of the court he had no hat on and no moustache.

Inspector JOSEPH SIMMONDS, D Division. On January 8 McLoughlin at the Mansion House was placed with eight other men of a similar style and build, and was at once picked out by Drew as the man who snatched the rings in the shop. Before the identification McLoughlin was asked if he had any objection to make with regard to the men he was put up with; he said ""No."" Drew's fellowassistant was there but was unable to identify McLoughlin. I was present at Marlborough Street Police Court on January 11 when Drew gave evidence; he made a communication to me and I stopped Pender as he was leaving the court and told him I wanted to speak to him. I afterwards told him he would be charged with being concerned with McLoughlin in stealing the rings from the prosecutor's shop. He said, ""I know nothing about it. In fact, I do not know where Great Portland Street is."" He said he had been a man servant, and resided at the Hope Club, Connaught Street, and that being out of employment he had come into court to hear the cases.

Cross-examined. Pender denied it from the first strenuously. He at once gave his address. The Hope Club is a reputable club for high-class servants out of employment. I have heard that Pender has been in service under Lord Dudley and in the Duke of Connaught's household.

On his Lordship's suggestion, Mr. Fletcher agreed that there was not sufficient evidence against Pender, and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty.

THOMAS PENDER , called by McLoughlin. The first time I ever saw you was on Monday, January 11, when listening to the case.

EDWARD MCLOUGHLIN (prisoner, not on oath) said that he was at the Mansion House on the charge to which he had pleaded guilty when Drew came into the room and identified him as the man who

on February 19 had stolen a number of rings from him. He was not guilty of the present charge.

Verdict, Guilty.

Prisoner was convicted in June, 1908, of stealing nine gold chatelaine bags, value £136, from the shop of Messrs. Sidney. He was then unknown, but was stated to have come from Liverpool. He had now given no information about the stolen property, none of which had been recovered.

Sentence, Five years' penal servitude on each indictment, to run concurrently. The Common Serjeant said that if prisoner thought fit to assist in the recovery of the stolen property by giving information to the police, it would be taken into consideration by the Home Secretary. He also ordered that the £16 found on the prisoner be handed over to Mr. String. Also that the prisoner be ordered under the Act (8 Edw. VII., c. 15) to pay the costs of the prosecution, and (so far as the Statute gave power) that he be further imprisoned until the costs were paid.

BEFORE JUDGE LUMLEY SMITH.

(Thursday, January 14.)"
Violent Theft,"MICHAEL BESTON , labourer, 28, Broad Way Charmers, Deptford. On January 1 I met prisoners between 12 and one o'clock in the ""Fountain"" public-house. I knew Burke well, but the other prisoner only by sight. In the ""Fountain"" I asked Burke to have a drink and called for three ales. From there we went to the ""Druid's Head,"" Church Street, Deptford, where we were refused drinks. Having been refused we went to the ""Centuries"" at the corner of High Street, Deptford, and had four or five drinks, for which I paid. We were in there about an hour. From the ""Centurion"" we went to the ""Duke of Cambridge"" and had a drink there. From there we went to the ""Regent,"" and finally arrived at the ""Oxford Arms,"" where we were again refused. We were all drunk. I then went to the urinal to make water. Burke followed me cut and Bresenham followed Burke. In the urinal Burke pulled me down and Bresenham pulled the pocket out of my trousers and went through my pockets. I had 3d. 8d. in money, a purse, and a pawnticket. I was not hurt. They ran away, leaving me on the ground, one going in one direction and the other in another. I went home after that, and an hour and a half afterwards went to the Greenwich Police Station and informed the police. Prisoners were brought in about a quarter of an hour afterwards. While I was telling the inspector the charge Bresenham used obscene language and threatened to shoot me if he went to prison over me and called me a f——g bastard. Burke said nothing to me or when he was charged.

HENRY ANDERSON . I am a hand working on the ""Band of Hope"" barge at Deptford. About four o'clock on January 1 I was standing in Church Street, outside the ""Oxford Arms."" I saw the two prisoners and prosecutor coming up Church Street together, all the worse for drink, prosecutor being a little worse than prisoners. I heard them call for drinks, which were refused, and they went outside and all three went into the urinal. The next I saw was prisoner Bresenham coming out of the urinal, which belongs to the Borough Council. He was followed by Burke and they went in different directions. When prosecutor came out I noticed that his trousers pocket was torn out on the left-hand side. He said something to me and went in the direction taken by the prisoner Bresenham. I did not see any woman there, I could not say whether prosecutor's pocket was torn out before he went into the ""Oxford Arms. ""

Detective HENRY HELBY, R Division. On January 1 I was prisoner at Blackheath road Station. He showed me his trousers and I noticed that the pocket had been torn away. I also noticed that his back was covered with slime. In consequence of a statement made to me, I, in company with Sergeant Tarbard, arrested the two prisoners. I saw Bresenham in a public-house in High Street, Deptford, and said to him, ""I shall arrest you for being concerned with Burke in robbing a man in a urinal Deptford."" He said, ""It was not me that fetched his money. It was that one-eyed cow that he was with."" He was taken to the station, and, on being charged, said to prosecutor. ""I will f——g well kill you, you bastard."" His language was very coarse all the time. I searched him and found nothing on him.

Detective-sergeant HARRY TARBARD. I went with last witness to arrest Barke. I told him I should arrest him for being associated with Patrick Bresenham in robbing a man in a urinal in Church Street that afternoon. He said, ""I did not have his b—money."" I took him to the station where he was charged. Nothing was found on him. He was sober. Prosecutor who had been drunk but was then sober repeated his statement in the presence of the prisoners. Burke said, ""I will shoot you if you get time. If I get time I will shoot you when I come out,"" and was very violent in his manner.

Verdict. Not guilty.

The Recorder agreed that there was not sufficient evidence. Prosecutor was evidently beastly drunk and his evidence was not to be relied on."
Breaking Peace,"MABEL MURIEL MURRAY . I am cook, in a situation in Camberwell Grove. I have known prisoner about nine months. On January 17 he came to my master's house in the evening; we were together in my room for about two hours; he pushed me on to the bed and put his hand on my throat and said he was going to strangle me. I got away from him. Later on we were in the kitchen. He picked up a knife and said, ""Suppose I was to?"" I went up the area door. He followed and caught me on the steps. He took hold of me from the back and I felt him cut me with the knife across my throat and face. I screamed and someone came and took him off me. He has on several occasions threatened to take my life. He said he was out of work and saw no prospects, and that he did not want anyone else to have me.

Cross-examined. I was not engaged to prisoner; he had asked me to marry him, and if he had kept in work it is more than likely that we should have been married. After a time I found I did not care for him very much, and I told him I should, go out with somebody else.

HENRY GILBERT . On January 17 I was in the house at Camberwell visiting the housemaid, while prisoner was visiting prosecutrix. I had just left the house when I heard a scream. I turned and saw prosecutrix rushing up the steps; at the top step she fell, and prisoner caught hold of her and they were struggling together. I rushed up and pulled him off; as I did so a knife dropped out of his hand. He said to me,"" I wonder if I have done her in.""

Police-constable THOMAS CURTIS, 35 P. In the early morning of January 18 I saw prisoner in Draycot Place. I said, ""What is your name?"" he said, ""I have no name."" I said, ""I believe you are Arthur Bird, and I am going to arrest you for attempting to murder your sweetheart last evening."" he said, ""You have made a mistake."" On the way to the station he said, ""How is she?""

Inspector ALBERT HAWKINS, P Division, said that when he told prisoner at the police-station that he would be detained for wounding his sweetheart, prisoner replied, ""Well, I have done it and shall have to put up with it.""

CHARLES COOPER CRIPPS , surgeon, 195, Camberwell Road. I examined prosecutrix on the night of January 17. She was suffering from a wound across the jaw on the left side; she also had a wound on the right side, cutting through the angle of the mouth about an inch and a half outwards horizontally, a small superficial wound under the lip, and another wound on the left arm. There must have been three separate blows. The wounds might have been caused by the knife produced.

Cross-examined. The severity of the wounds would naturally have been increased by the struggling of the girl.

WILLIAM J. C. KEATS , surgeon at Camberwell Infirmary, to which prosecutrix was sent by the last witness, similarly described the nature of her injuries. She has now quite recovered, but she is permanently disfigured.

The Lord Chief Justice directed the Jury that there was no evidence of intent to murder.

Verdict, Guilty of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.

Sentence, 18 months' hard labour.

BEFORE THE RECORDER."
Killing,"Mr. Muir and Mr. Leycester prosecuted; Mr. Burnie defended (at the request of the Court).

Before the Jury were put in charge, prisoner, on the advice of her counsel, withdrew her plea upon the indictment and pleaded guilty of manslaughter. The prosecution offered no evidence on the charge of murder, and upon that a verdict of Not guilty was returned.

Prisoner had cohabited with Friend for four or five years, both being of intemperate habits. In the course of a quarrel, prisoner stabbed Friend in the chest with a stocking needle and he died from the injuries. Prisoner had been several times convicted for drunkenness, and once for assault upon a workhouse matron.

Mr. Justice Phillimore said that prisoner might consider herself fortunate that the Grand Jury had thrown out the bill for murder. She, with malice in her heart against the man, had stabbed Friend, not in self-defence and with very slight immediate provocation. The case was one very little short of murder, and prisoner must go to penal servitude for 12 years."
Theft,"Dr. JOHN KEMPSTER . I saw prisoner at South-Western Police Court on February 25. He had two scars on the ball of the left thumb, one an old one and one more recent. The latter appeared to have been caused seven or eight weeks before by broken glass or something of a sharp nature.

Cross-examined. I can only say that the recent scar had been caused by something sharp; I cannot say by glass.

ALBERT BOLTON . I was caretaker at Mrs. Ingpen's house, 42, East-court Road, Battersea, on December 30 last. She was away from home and I and my wife were in charge. Before going to bed that night I closed all the doors and barred the inner door. About one o'clock in the morning I heard a noise End came crown with a candle in my hand. I heard them rush across the kitchen, and I darted on them and caught this man here by the throat, and I was fetched down with a big pot. I got up, and then I was hit in the eye with a long-handled broom and knocked down again. I sprang to my feet again, and that man there ran away and left me for dead, with Wood in my eyes so that I could hardly see. Then the policeman came and took Harvey, the other man that I had got hold of, out of my arms just as I was falling back, because I was done, and this man got away by the back through the window, because he knew the house. I was took to bed and the doctor dressed me. I did not see prisoner disappear, because I was too badly injured where he knocked me down and gave me terrible blows while I was down, and my eye was all out, and the doctor thought I was going * to lose it, and I have not been able to work since. I gave evidence when Harvey was convicted and sentenced to five years for the burglary and three years for doing me grievous bodily harm.

Cross-examined. I did not see either of the two thieves before I heard the noise and came down. I saw prisoner last July, when he came to the house for the girl on two occasion. Directly I got into the kitchen on December 31 I put the candle on the table; and that is all the light there was. The man whose throat I caught hold of was in the back washhouse four steps down from the kitchen I could not see him. I saw the face of the other man after I got him in the kitchen in the light. It was in the wash-house where I, was struck in the eye with the broom and when I was knocked on the head with a pot. Then the two men went into the kitchen where the light was and I followed them. I was very much dazed after

my injuries, but I am a very strong fellow. It was in the kitchen I caught hold of Harvey; the other man had then gone through the drawing-room window because the police had come. He went quickly, and did not give me much opportunity of seeing his face. I saw Harvey's face in the kitchen, but the face of the second man I never saw at all; I was too much knocked about. I could not properly swear that prisoner is the second man, but I am sure he is, because he left his boots and his hat behind. When prisoner was in custody I was taken to the police-station to identify him, and I did touch the wrong man, but he was a man very much like prisoner, and if he had had his overcoat on I should have known him. I only touched the man because I wanted him to turn round, not because I thought he was one of the thieves.

Re-examined: I did not see prisoner's face on that night, but I have seen him out with the servant girl Dulcie. Both the men had their boots off. It was a foggy night.

Mrs. BOLTON , wife of last witness. On the morning of December 31 my husband was disturbed by noise and went downstairs; I heard a scuffling and I went down too. At the foot of the stairs I saw a man at the front door trying to get out. I heard my husband crying for help, and I ram to his assistance and saw him struggling with Harvey. I made for the area door to call for (help, and when I opened the door I found two police-con stables entering the gate, so I let them in. My husband had got hold of Harvey, though he was so bad, and handed him over to the constable. When I saw prisoner at the foot of the stairs when I came down, he said, ""Don't touch me, else I'll out you."" When he found he could not get out of the front door he darted through the passage again into the drawingroom and 'broke the window and got through into the back garden. I did not see him do that, but I saw the window afterwards and there were bloodstains on the snow down—the steps from the Window; it was a French window. I did not see the man's face, but there is a gas lamp outside the door which shows through (the glass part of the door very plainly, and I knew him by his form and has voice when he called out. It was prisoner. I had seen him once or twice last June when he called for the servant, Mrs. Hart that is now. The men had collected a lot of things on the kitchen table ready to be removed.

Cross-examined. The front door is about two year's from the foot of the stairs; when the man threatened me I went at once to help my husband, so that I was not a second in the hall. I did not see the man come back from the door and go into the drawing-room. I am quite certain it was the man who used to come and visit the servant; I knew him by his voice and his form—square shoulders and slim. I told the police what I had seen, but I was not taken to the station to identify anybody. I am quite certain prisoner is the man whom I saw in the hall. I did say before the magistrate that 1 was surer then than I was before.

Re-examined. Have seen prisoner three times and have had short conversation with him.

Police-constable AMBROSE . On night of December 30 I saw a light at the back of the premises in question, and kept watch with another constable. I beard a struggle and then the light went out, and I went round to the front door and saw a man trying to get out of the door. He then turned back, and we burst the side door open. I saw tube caretaker struggling with Harvey, who had a large saucepan in his hand. I also saw prisoner's face as he was going in the direction of the stairs. I did not see him again until I identified him after he was arrested.

Cross-examined. I did say to the magistrate that I did not give a description of prisoner. When I identified him he had a hat on; the man I saw in the hall had not got a hat on.

Mrs. MILLARD . I keep a confectioner's shop at 275, Waterloo Road. Have known prisoner eight or nine years. I also know Harvey. On December 30 prisoner and Harvey came to my. Shop between seven and eight p.m.; they had refreshment; Harvey said they were short of money and would pay later. Miller said, ""We are going to do a 'bust' at Barnes."" ""Bust"" means a burglary. Harvey said, ""We won't go to-night, Bert."" Miller said, ""Yes, we will; it is a foggy might and the girl is all right."" Harvey said, ""Well, come along."" I next saw Miller between 11 and 12 the following morning in my shop. He said, ""We have done the bust, ""' and he told me Harvey was pinched. *I noticed he had a handkerchief round his hand; he said a window fell on it.

Cross-examined. All the boys call me Ma; some of them have been in penal servitude. Harvey and Miller were always straightforward, gentlemanly little fellows to me. I sometimes receive letters for the boys. Sometimes detectives call and make inquiries of me. It was not my duty to inform the police that these two men were going to commit a burglary, and if the police had not questioned me they would not have got any information.

Mrs. KNIGHT , 22, West Square, Southwark. Miller was a lodger in my house on December 30. Harvey called for Miller about 10 p.m., and they left together soon afterwards. I went into Millers room shortly afterwards; the bed was made, and his laundry and a few lumps of sugar were on the bed. Prisoner did not return that night. I went into his room about eight o'clock next morning, the bed had not been slept in, and the laundry and the sugar were still lying on it. He came in shortly after 11 that morning and washed and went away. Some time afterwards I noticed he had a cut on his hand. He lodged in my house down to the time of his arrest. He had never been absent the whole night except on that one occasion.

Cross-examined. It was about a fortnight afterwards when I noticed the wound on his hand.

Detective-sergeant WARD , L Division. I know Miller and Harvey well. About eight p.m. on December 30 I saw them together in Waterloo Road. Next day I saw Miller alone in Waterloo Road and noticed that he walked with a limp and had a bandage round his left hand. I asked him what was the matter, and he said he had been

cleaning a window and fell through. I asked him where Harvey was and he said he had gone back to the infirmary. On February 16 I went with Sergeant Cornish to 22, West Square, and told prisoner he would be charged with the burglary and causing grievous bodily harm to the caretaker. He said, ""You are mad."" I said, ""A man named Harvey is in custody and you are believed to have been concerned with him."" He said, ""Where is your evidence; Harvey will not say I am the man and you have got to prove it."" On the way to the station he said about the scar on his hand, ""People can get scars without committing burglary.""

Cross-examined. I could not tell you when I had seen Harvey and Miller before December 30, but I fix that date because I had an inquiry at the Surrey Music Hall and I was on my way there when I saw them.

Sergeant HARVEY . I was present when prisoner was brought to Kennington Lane. I conveyed him from there to Wandsworth Common Police Station. On the way I said to him, ""You know what you are in custody for?"" he said, ""Yes, and you have got a job to prove it."" When charged he replied, ""Well, what happens next?"" On December 31 I visited 42, Eastcourt Road. The French window in the drawing-room had been broken from the inside and there was blood upon it. The catch of the kitchen window appeared to have been forced by a knife.

Cross-examined. I did not say to prisoner when charged, ""Do you know Harvey?"" and he did not reply, ""Yes, worse luck."" He did not say to me, ""If you put me up for identification Harvey cannot identify me, he cannot say I am the man."" He did not say, ""His stating that I am the other man is not enough to get me convicted."" Mrs.HART. Prior to my marriage in December I was a servant of Mrs. Ingpen, 42, Eastcourt Road, Battersea. I knew prisoner; he had been to the house on more than one occasion and I had been out with him. I left Mrs. Ingpen's service on December 21. I did not tell prisoner that, and, as far as I know, he thought I was still there.

Cross-examined. I am positive prisoner never saw Mr. Bolton at the house, but he has seen Mrs. Bolton there.

JAMES HARVEY . I am undergoing a sentence of five years' penal servitude in Chelmsford Gaol for burglary at 42, Eastcourt Road. I have known prisoner about six years. I was with him in Mrs. Millard's shop on afternoon of burglary. He told Mrs. Millard that we were both going to burgle a house at Barnes somewhere. In the first instance we were going to do it on the Thursday night, but we agreed to go on the Wednesday. He said he knew the house and the servant. I called at West Square for Miller and we left there about half-past 10 and walked to the house. We got there about 12"" and waited in a shed in the next-door garden until the place was clear. We then got over the wall into the garden and got into the house through the kitchen window, which Miller opened with a knife. We took our boots off, Miller went into the front room and made a noise and then the caretaker came down. We saw we couldn't get out of the kitchen, so we ran into the scullery, but found the door

bolted. The caretaker in following into the scullery fell down the steps. He was not struck with a broom at all. We had a struggle, and in the struggle Miller left, leaving me with the caretaker. Soon after Miller left the caretaker's wife came into the scullery, and just after that two policemen came, and I was arrested.

Cross-examined. I struck the caretaker with my boot two or three times on the head. That was to try and make sure of him. I did not ask anybody to come to Chelmsford Gaol. Miller's arrest was nothing to do with me at all. I expect to serve my full sentence with the ordinary remission.

Sergeant YOUNG . I examined the premises; the French window was broken, the glass lying out on the garden side, and I noticed footsteps and a trail of blood across the garden to the fence and also a large dab of Wood on the fence. A man could have got out of the broken window.

Verdict, Guilty.

Detective-sergeant BUTTERS , Y Division. Prisoner was sentenced at North London Sessions on November 20, 1906, to 15 months for stealing luggage from Paddington Station and a second indictment for stealing clothes from a doctor's house. On October 22, 1900, he was sentenced at Brighton Quarter Sessions to two months and one month for stealing boots; On. April 7, 1902, to three months at Marlborough Street for stealing clothing; on February 16, 1904, at Marlborough Street, to three separate six months for stealing overcoats and things in halls of houses.

Police-constable WARD . I have known prisoner for the past five years as an associate of criminals and have never known him to do any respectable work. When I searched (him I found three pawntickets relating to three rings, part of a number obtained by fraud at Dorking on February 11, and pawned by prisoner on the 12th, and there is a warrant out at Dorking, but they are not desirous of proceeding with it.

Sentence, Five years' penal servitude."
Damage to Property,"WILFRID DULKEN , partner in G. and H. Green, timber merchants, Millwall. On March 27 we had at our wharf a very large quantity of jute, hemp, and other inflammable fibres. Just after one in the

afternoon it was reported to me that the place was on fire. The fire lasted about four days and the loss amounted to at least £40,000.

WILLIAM CAYGILL , foreman to Messrs. Green. On March 27, about noon, I noticed prisoner loitering about the wharf; he was not engaged there at all. I left off work at one o'clock; the place was then left in charge of Pascoe. Just after I left Pascoe came and told me the jute had been set fire to.

THOMAS PASCOE . I am 16 years old and work for Messrs. Green. When I was left in charge of the wharf at one o'clock on March 27 prisoner came in; he produced a box of matches and made to light a cigarette. I told him, ""You must not smoke here; our men don't do that. If a spark touched one of the bales the whole place would be on fire."" He lit the cigarette and put the lighted match against a bale of jute, which at once caught fire. I tried to put it out with my cap, But it was too much for me, so I ran and told Caygill.

To Prisoner. I did not see you try to put the flames out; possibly you did try.

Detective HENRY CAMPKIN , K Division. On March 27, at a quarter to seven p.m., prisoner came up to me in West Ferry Road and said, ""Here I am; I will give myself up for the fire; I did not know if would be as bad as this; I am very sorry; I was on the wharf and lighting a fag; I threw the match amongst the jute; I then ran away and stayed in the dock all the afternoon.""

Inspector ALFRED BALL , K Division, said that on prisoner being charged at the police station he said, ""I know I did wrong, sir, and that is why I gave myself up. When the boy told me I must not smoke I lit a match and pushed it against the stuff to frighten him. When I tried to put it out I could not, so I went away.""

Prisoner now handed in the following statement: ""I set fire to the jute in order to frighten the boy who was in charge of it. I intended to put the fire out just after I lit it, but it burnt so quickly that it was impossible for me to do so. I then ran away as far as Millwall Dock. Hearing that the police were in search of me, I went up to a constable and gave myself up. I am very sorry that I acted so foolishly, and I hope that you will deal leniently with me.""

Verdict, Guilty, with a recommendation to mercy, the Jury accepting prisoner's statement that he merely meant to frighten the boy.

Nothing criminal is known against the prisoner.

Sentence, Three months' imprisonment, second division."
Royal Offences,"ETHEL YETTON . I help my father, who keeps the ""Rising Sun,"" Green Street, Bethnal Green. On Thursday, March 25, I was serving in the bar when prisoner came in and asked for a small lemon and dash, costing 2 1/2 d. He paid with the 2e. piece (produced), and I gave him, the change. When prisoner was gone I found the coin was a bad one, and showed it to the barman. On the following Saturday he came in again about half-past eight and asked for a glass of beer, costing 2d. He again tendered a 2s. piece in payment. I recognised him as the man who had come in on the previous Thursday, and gave the coin to my father, who spoke to prisoner.

To Prisoner. I did not know you as a customer, 80 far as I know you had never been in the house before March 25.

To the Court. I am sure prisoner is the man.

WILLIAM YETTON , licensee of the ""Rising Sun."" On March 25 my daughter showed me a coin. On the 27th she again spoke to me and I then saw prisoner in the bar. I asked him if he had any more coins like that produced, which I had previously bent on the counter. He said, ""I nave some other money on me,"" and pulled out a good shilling to pay for the drink. My daughter gave him change for the shilling. I went outside to look for a constable, but did cot see one. I saw prisoner go up Green Street and followed him into Cambridge Road, where I lost sight of him. I gave a description of him with the coin to the police. I saw. him some weeks afterwards at Old Street Police Court, where I identified him.

LOUISA CROMER . I help my sister, Mrs. Garrett, who keeps the ""Queen's Hotel,"" 274, Victoria Park Road. I first saw prisoner about two o'clock on April 11; I think it was a Sunday. He came into the bar and asked for a pony of bitter, costing 1d. He tendered in payment the counterfeit florin produced. I turned to Mrs. Garrett and told her it was a bad 2s. piece, and also showed it to Mr. Garrett. I told prisoner the coin was bad, and asked him if he had any more on him. He said ¡he did not know it Was a ¡bad one. Then my brother-in-law went for a policeman. Prisoner wanted to be searched then and there.

WILLIAM THOMAS GARRETT . My wife is licensee of the ""Queen's Hotel."" I saw prisoner tender the coin to the last witness. My assistant gave me a prearranged signal. I went round to the bar, shut the door, and sent for the police. Prisoner said he thought the coin was all right. When the policeman came prisoner asked to be. searched, but there was no convenience for searching him.

Police constable ROBERT GOLDMAN , 608 J, gave evidence of arresting prisoner. He asked prisoner where he got the coin from, and he said he did not know. He also asked ¡him if he knew it was a bad one, and he said he did not. Prisoner was searched at the station, and there were found on him six shillings, two sixpences, and 2 1/2 d. good money. In reply to the charge, prisoner said that a man gave him the counterfeit florin on London Bridge.

Police-constable WILLIAM WOOD , J, gave evidence that prisoner stated at the station that he had worked for a Mr. Piper, 40, Hackney Road, for the last two years, and lived at 120, Cooper's Gardens,

close by, and that Mr. Piper had paid him 20s. wages on the previous Thursday night, the counterfeit 2s. being amongst the money paid. On making inquiries prisoner found these statements to be false. Mr. Piper had not paid him any wages on the previous Thursday, and prisoner was not known at the address he gave, though he was known in the neighbourhood. When charged at the station prisoner repeated the statement about the florin having been given to him by a man on London Bridge.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , officer of the Mint, said he had examined the three coins, but owing to the way they had been dealt with as exhibits, paper being pasted over a great part of them, he could not say whether they were all from the same mould.

Verdict, Guilty. A number of convictions were proved.

Sentence, Nine months' imprisonment for each of the three offences, the sentences to run concurrently."
Deception,"WILLIAMS, John (45, clerk) ; forging and uttering, knowing the same to be forged, certain orders for the payment of money, to wit, bankers' cheques for £500, £500, £500, £549 4s. 3d., £500, £825 13s. 5d., £2, 000, £1, 500, and £850 respectively, in each case with intent to defraud; forging and uttering, knowing the same to be forged, a certain order for the payment of money, to wit, a bankers' cheque for the payment of £700, with intent to defraud.

Mr. Muir prosecuted; Mr. George Elliott, K. C., appeared for prisoner.

Prisoner pleaded guilty to three indictments out of ten, charging him with forging a cheque for £1, 500 on November 9, 1908, a cheque for £850 on May 1, 1909, and a cheque for £700 on May 4, 1909.

Mr. Muir observed that he did not know the grounds of distinction which caused prisoner to plead not guilty to the other indictments, but he did not feel justified in taking up the time of the Court by trying them, but would ask that they should remain on the file. In 1888 prisoner was a tradesman in a small way of business in Wales and became bankrupt, and disappeared from Wales an undischarged bankrupt. Thence he went to America, and in 1892 left the service he was in there with good testimonials. In 1896 he entered the service of Messrs. Raphael Tuck and Sons, Limited, as clerk at a salary of £2 a week, and in 1899 entered the counting-house of the American branch of the house in London as bookkeeper and cashier at a salary of £260. He then proceeded to use his position of trust for the purpose of committing these extensive forgeries, amounting, so far as could be discovered, to £29, 243, the loss being, however, reduced to £24, 700 by a loan of £4, 500 obtained by prisoner from a bank in Wales. Prisoner posed as a man of wealth, and the destination of a good deal of the stolen money was the development of a colliery in Wales which he had acquired. In 1908, being ambitious of the political representation of that part of Wales in which he had lived, it was necessary for him to get rid of his old bankruptcy, and it was accordingly annulled by the payment of the liabilities.

The Recorder suggested an adjournment for the purpose of enabling prisoner to make an assignment to Messrs. Raphael Tuck, but it was stated that this was not feasible, as fresh bankruptcy proceedings had been instituted.

Sentence, Three years' penal servitude."
Royal Offences,"Detective HENRY RUTTER, H Division. About 10 a.m., on July 3, I was on duty in Duval Street in company with Detective Stevens. I taw prisoner in the passage of a common lodging-house. He came tares times to the door and seemed to me to be acting in a suspicious dinner. He afterwards left and went into Commercial Street and got on to an omnibus which was proceeding towards Shoreditch. I got on to the omnibus and told prisoner I was a police officer. He

said, ""What do you want me for? "" I replied, ""I suspect you of having some counterfeit money in your possession."" He said, ""You have made a mistake; not me."" I took him to the station. I found a counterfeit florin in his left vest pocket and the other nine coins wrapped in tissue paper were in the peak of his cap. He said, ""I plead guilty to having them in my possession, but not to uttering them A man asked me to take ₤1 worth of silver for him and I took it. "" He was charged, but made no reply to the charge.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER, officer of the Mint, deposed that the coins were all counterfeit and from the same mould.

Verdict, Guilty.

Nine previous convictions were proved.

Sentence, Four years' penal servitude."
Theft,"Detective-constable FREDERICK GUNNER , C Division. At 8.30 a.m., on July 23, I was at Fresh Wharf with Detective-constable Miller. I saw the three prisoners amongst a number of persons attempting to go on the board the pleasure steamers. I was about a yard and a half away. Tippett said something to Clark and Lockyer and both commenced to push behind prosecutor. Tippett crouched down and with his right hand took this purse from prosecutor's back hip-pocket and put it in his right-hand jacket pocket and commenced to leave the crowd. I made my way amongst the people and said, ""I am a police officer; what have you got in that pocket?"" I took him into custody. I had not seen prisoners before. On the way to the station Lockyer struggled to get away and struck me in the chest.

Cross-examined by Mr. Black. Miller had Clark in custody then. I said at the' police-court I was afraid he was going to get away. When I put the hold on him he stopped struggling. I put my arms round his neck. He might have struggled to relieve the pressure I was putting upon him. 10s. 10d. was found on him.

Cross-examined by Mr. Purcell. There were few people where I was because I was over some ropes where the public were not allowed to go. When I arrested Tippett, Clark turned to leave. When searched at the station Clark had 14s. 4d. on him. Clark had no ticket for the boat upon him. I said at the police-court, ""It is, I believe, absolutely necessary to take your ticket before going on the boat, but I am not certain. ""Clark might have intended, as prosecutor did, to take his ticket on the boat.

Detective-constable WILLIAM MILLE confirmed the evidence of the previous witness.

WILLIAM HENRY WINTER , 8, Elliott Road, Reading. On July 23 I was going by the boat from Fresh Wharf. I had a purse containing £5 10s. and other articles. It was stolen. I do not know by whom.

(Defence.)

WILLIAM CLARK (prisoner, on oath). I live at Nelson Street, City Road. I had an appointment to meet Mr. Staples at 8 a. m. at the Monument Station, to go by the boat to Southend. He did not meet me. I then went to Fresh Wharf and was arrested two or three minutes afterwards on this charge. I was not going to book if I did not see my friend. I had no conversation with any one there.

Cross-examined. I did not know Tippett.

WILLIAM STAPLES , 20, Rosebery Street, Southgate Road. I have known Clark about three years. On July 22 we arranged to go to Southend on the 23rd. He said he would meet me at the Tube station, London Bridge, at eight o'clock. I was unable to be there, as I had

to go to 1, Upper Baker Street, about a job, a pipe-cleaning machine of Mr. Burrough's went wrong. I did not know where Clark lived or I should have let him know. (To the Jury.) I only know one Tube station—at the Monument.

Verdict, Lockyer and Clark, Not guilty.

Several convictions were proved against Tippett.

Sentence, 20 months' hard labour."
Royal Offences,"Sergeant HENRY GARANRD, G Division. About 11 a.m. on September 24 I was with Sergeant Leach in Old Street, St. Luke's, when I saw prisoner loitering. I asked him what he was loitering about for and he said, ""lam waiting for a friend over the road."" I noticed he kept his left hand in his left waistcoat pocket and I asked him what he had got there. He said, ""Nothing."" I told him to take his hand out and he did so, exposing some pieces of tissue paper. Leach took out one of the coins that were wrapped up and said, ""What's this?"" It was a counterfeit shilling. He said, ""I'm trying to earn a few coppers by them."" I then took nine others, eight of which were wrapped up in tissue paper and one separately, from his pocket. He said, ""Yes, I am glad it has come to this, because now I shall get some food. I have been starving and should only have done something desperate if this had not occurred."" I took him to the station. When charged he said, ""I have been working for Woolridge for the

last ten years. For the last two years work has been very slack and I have earned very little. This morning I met a man in a public-house. He asked me if I wanted to earn a few pence and I said Yes.' He said, 'Well, carry these for me,' and gave me the coins done up in tissue paper. Then I went round some streets with him and was waiting for him when you came up and arrested me.""

Cross-examined. It is correct that prisoner has been working for the last ten years with Mr. Woolridge, of Upper Thames Street. He had been leading a respectable life up to about three weeks before his arrest, when he was out of a job. I do not know what he has been doing during that time. He said he had been sleeping about the streets. He was a printer and embosser and was discharged through slackness. He described the man who gave him the coins, but he could not give us his address.

Police-sergeant CHARLES LEACH, G Division, corroborated the evidence of the last witness.

WILLIAM JOHN WEBSTER , Inspector of Coins, H.M. Mint. These ten shillings are all counterfeit and all from the same mould. Coiners sell these by the load, 10 being half a load.

Cross-examined. The price they used to charge for a load of shillings would be 2s. or 3s.

Prisoner's statement before the Magistrate: ""I was trying to earn a few coppers. I did not know what they were until the officers told me,""

(Defence.)

ROBERT MILLINGTON (prisoner, on oath). About 11 a.m. on this day I was making my way towards the firm where I had been previously working and I went in to have a drink. A very respectably dressed man started talking to me and in the course of the conversation I said I was going to my job and I had not done anything for a fortnight. He asked me if I would care to earn a few ha'pence and, on my saying I would, he asked me to come outside, where he gave me a little parcel done up in paper and told me to put in into my pocket. I asked him what it was and he said, ""You have got nothing to be afraid of."" I put it in my pocket and he told me to wait at the corner. I had not been waiting a minute before I was arrested. I was curious to see what the parcel contained and I had my hand in my pocket just pulling it out. I had never seen the man before, but I should know him again. I did not know the coins were counterfeit until the officers told me. I am a printer and have been in regular employment, with the exception of the last two years, of which I can account for 18 months.

Cross-examined. The little parcel was in newspaper when he gave it to me. The officer did not take the coins out separately. He was not away a minute before he came back again. I suppose now that he was uttering these coins and he was paying me to hold the coins. The police found on me a sixpence and five coppers and a penny packet

of sweets. The five coppers and the sweets the man gave me when he came back. Then he went away again and I saw no more of him. I told this story at the police station.

Verdict, Not guilty."
Breaking Peace,"BENJAMIN WRAGG , 18, Risinghill Street, Clerkenwell. At midnight on October 1 I was going home with my wife up Risinghill Street when, as we passed prisoner's door, he rushed out and hit me on the side of the head; I cannot say what with. I was knocked to the ground. I got up and was making my way towards my own door when he made an attempt to assault me again. I put up my arm and stopped him hitting me. He came at me with his fist on the second occasion. He then went after my wife. On the police coming up I was taken to the hospital. I did not see what he did to my wife. I had no idea why he should assault me. He had had a few words with my wife that day, but that did not concern me.

Cross-examined. The suggestion is that it was a chopper that he assaulted me with. I saw nothing at all in his hand. My child came and told me there had been a disturbance between him and my wife in Chapel Street, and that my wife had been interfered with. I had been ill and did not go to see what was the matter. I know she had not been interfering with a stall he had put up. She told me when she came home that she had been interfered with by prisoner and that she had been set upon by three or four, including prisoner and his wife. I did not have any sort of quarrel with my wife on this night. I swear I did not have a chopper in my belt. I did not when I got outside prisoner's house stand and call out, ""I have been waiting for you,"" or anything at all. He did not come to the window and say, ""All right; I'll be down in a minute."" I did not make a rush at him with the chopper when he came out, and he did not try and get it from me. He did not retire and I did not challenge him to fight. I never saw the chopper until it was at the police court My wife came to my assistance when I was on the ground and he punched her and dragged her about 20 yards along the street. I am sure I had nothing in my hand. I cannot say whether my wife was injured in the scuffle; I was too dazed. I did not see his landlady

nor a man named Bugg; at the time I was hit there was no one else in the street. The chopper picked up is not mine.

MARGARET WRAGG , wife of Benjamin Wragg. About 12.30 a.m. on October 2 I was coming down Risinghill Street with my husband when prisoner rushed out of his house and struck him. I turned round to assist him when he struck me on the head, and I fell down. I remembered no more until I found myself in the ambulance. I fainted again and did not come to till I was in the hospital, where I remained three hours, I am told.

Cross-examined. I keep a stall outside the ""Salmon and Compasses.' At 6.30 p.m. that day I said to prisoner, ""What about the stall,"" and he said, ""You would not have had a stall only for me."" With that he brought his wife out from the public house with two other women and they knocked me about because nine months before that there had been trouble between our children. Prisoner did not separate his wife and me. I was not drunk. My child was not there at the time. Shortly after my husband came up. I was not quarrelling with my husband when prisoner came out and hit my husband. My husband did not have a chopper. He did not call out to prisoner. He did not rush at prisoner when he came out. I rushed to his assistance when prisoner struck him. I must have received my injury in the course of the struggle that ensued. I did not see my husband get up and go towards our house because I was unconscious then. I had no weapon of any kind in my hand. I do not know what prisoner had in his hand. I do not know anybody of the name of Bugg. I did not go to Bugg's or anybody's shop and accuse him of using a chopper, neither did my sister. I did not say to him outside the police court ""What did you want to say my husband had a chopper for?"" Bugg's father told me that his son was offered half a sovereign. I did not know either the father or the son to speak to before this. I did not go to their oil shop at all after the police court proceedings.

BASIL HUGHES , Casualty Officer, Royal Free Hospital. Between 1 and 2 a.m. on October 2 Margaret Wragg was brought in suffering from pretty advanced concussion. She was very much dazed, and had lost a quantity of blood. She had a wound on the right side of her head caused undoubtedly by some sharp instrument such as this chopper. I attended to her and detained her for an hour or two. Her husband came in after her in a condition of concussion, not so advanced as his wife's. He had a similar wound on the right side of his head.

Cross-examined. In my opinion he had been drinking, but not very much. She had not. I cannot say whether they were sufficiently under the influence of drink to be excited.

Police-constable WILLIAM CHEESEMAN, 24 GR. At 12.50 a.m. on October 2 I was called by a whistle to this disturbance in Risinghill Street, and found Mrs. Wragg lying unconscious on the footway, bleeding profusely from a wound on her forehead. I rendered first aid and sent her to the hospital. In consequence of a statement she

made I went to 22, Risinghill Street, where I saw prisoner. I told him I should take him into custody for assault, and he said, ""All right, guv'nor, I will come with you."" He was taken to the station and charged, when he made no reply.

Cross-examined. Nothing was said by prisoner about a chopper. I do not know how it was obtained.

(Defence.)

THOMAS CHARLES BUGG . I work at an oil shop. On this night I saw prosecutor and his wife outside prisoner's house having a bit of a row together. Prosecutor dropped the chopper which he had in his belt, picked it up and put it in his belt again. Prsioner then came out of his house. I saw nothing in his hand. The next thing I saw was that they were all on the ground together. I tried to separate them and get the chopper away, which the prosecutor and prisoner had both got hold of. Just before they were all on the ground I saw Mrs. Wragg rush to her husband's assistance; I saw them both rush at prisoner. I saw nothing more after they were al on the ground as a crowd came round. Mrs. Wragg's head was bleeding and I tried to raise her. Then I heard a whistle and the police came and took her to the hospital. When I was outside the police court last Wednesday Mrs. Wragg said to me, ""What did you want to say my husband had the chopper for?"" She came to my shop the day after that and said that the chopper had been handed to me. Outside this Court her sister said, ""Wait till you set outside. You'll go through it.""

Cross-examined. When I saw the chopper I said to my father, who was with me, ""Look! that man has a chopper in his belt."" It was on his left side. When they got outside prisoner's house they began holloing. Then I saw prisoner standing at his street door, laughing, and prosecutor rushed at him. I was in front of his house at the time. I could not see prisoner coming downstairs.

Re-examined. Prosecutor shouted up to prisoner's window and then prisoner came down.

To the Court. I said before the Magistrate that I saw a chopper in prisoner's hand, holding it up, after the prosecutor picked it up This was after I saw Mrs. Wragg's head bleeding. I have not said this before because this is the first time I have been in a Court. I also said before the Magistrate that I and my father tried to get away the chopper from prisoner, but we did not succeed. I saw no blow struck and I did not see how the injuries were sustained. I saw prisoner at his door, laughing, and then I went to the bottom of the street and came back again and saw both Mr. and Mrs. Wragg's heads bleeding. Then Wragg said to prisoner, ""Come on and have a fight"" and started ""sparring up.""

WILLIAM H. WAINNER , vanguard boy. I was coming down Risinghill Street on this night when I saw prosecutor in the middle of the street challenging prisoner, who was at the window. Prisoner came

down and had got down about eight steps leading from his door when prosecutor rushed at him with something in his hand, which I could not see. Prisoner had nothing in his hand. When they got to the bottom of the steps they both fell down. The police then came up and turned me away.

Cross-examined. It was dark. The thing in prosecutor's hand looked like a chopper.

To the Court. I saw no woman on the ground. Prosecutor's head was not bleeding while I was there.

CHARLES MULLAYNE . I was in Risinghall Street on this evening when I saw prosecutor standing in the middle of the road with a chopper ""flashing"" in his hand. He shouted out to prisoner, ""Come down here and I'll chop you in half with this."" I could not see any more because I was pushed away by the police.

Cross-examined. I saw no blows struck.

To the Court. Fighting was going on, but I never saw it. I never saw anybody carried away. There were one or two policemen there with prosecutor, but they left him alone.

ELIZABETH COLLIS , 22b, Risinghall Street. I am prisoner's landlady. Between 12 and 12.30 p.m. on October 2 prisoner came down-stairs I held a light to light him down. He had nothing in his hand. He went out of the street door.

JAMES FARENDEN (prisoner, on oath). On the morning of October 1 I had put up some stalls. At 6.30 p.m. I went to the ""Salmon and Compasses"" with my wife and on coming out I found there was a disturbance with Mrs. Wragg. I told her she ought not to be making a row, as if it had not been for me she would not have had a stall at all. With that she called me a foul name. My wife came out of the public-house and they started fighting. We parted them. I and my wife then got our dinner in and went home and went to bed about 8 p.m. I was woken up by somebody shouting, ""Come down. I've been waiting for you."" I looked out of the window and said I would be down in a minute. I did not know who it was then. I then went down, the landlady giving me a light, and directly I got outside prosecutor rushed at me with the chopper. We closed and in the struggle the chopper was taken away from us; we were both holding it on the ground. Mrs. Wragg came to her husband's assistance and caught me by the handkerchief round my neck. We were then parted and they went down towards their place. The police came and took me in charge. The prosecutor returned and made a row outside my house. I believe Mrs. Wragg was being taken to the hospital then.

Cross-examined. They may have been 100 people there for all I know. I think he was brandishing something when I looked out of the window.

Re-examined. I was in liquor when I went to bed.

ALFRED WILSON (builder) stated that prisoner, whom he had known seven years, was of good character and a peaceable man.

BASIL HUGHES , recalled by the Jury, stated that the blows must have been somewhat severe in each case to have caused the resulting concussions.

Verdict, Guilty, the Jury adding, ""We think there may have been provocation.""

Sentence, Three months, hard labour."
Theft,"Inspector WILLIAM EVANS (Birmingham Police). Prisoner pleaded guilty and was sentenced at Birmingham to two terms of four years' penal servitude to run concurrently. Two days before he was tried I received a warrant from the City of London Police in the event of his discharge. They requested me not to mention the charge with which he is now indicted. There was no mention made to the Recorder at Birmingham of any charges which were pending against prisoner; simply his criminal history was told to the Recorder. I have a translation of a letter from the French police—which says that besides four months' imprisonment in November, 1909, he was convicted of theft on September 14, 1905 at Paris. That was mentioned at Birmingham. An expulsion order was made on November 6, 1905.

Inspector HINE, City Police. I was in touch with the prosecutors and they asked me not to mention this charge, as they thought it a case that should come before the London Court.

Cross-examined. I knew the pearls were insured. I do not know the conditions of the policy. It is an invariable condition that the victim must prosecute the thief.

Sentence, Four years' penal servitude; recommended for expulsion under the Aliens Act."
Theft,"Mr. Huntly Jenkins prosecuted. Prisoner was tried on the first indictment.

WILLIS GIBBINS , chief officer s.s. Inanda, registered British ship now lying in the West India Dock, produced certificate of British registry. Prisoner signed articles in London on September 1, 1910, as A.B. for the voyage to Durban and back. She left London on September 2 and arrived in Durban on September 28. We carried three passage workers, who were employed to take care of horses and who all left the ship at Durban. The Inanda loaded up and left Durban on October 15. The Rev. Henry Grellier was a passenger from Durban to London and came on board on October 15. Prisoner had no business in any passenger's cabin.

Rev. HENRTY GRELLIER, 44, Station Road, Epsom. I travelled by the s.s. Inanda, of the Rennie Line, from Durban to London, joining the ship on October 15.; Gold watch produced is mine. I had it in my possession up to the night of Monday, November 7, when, with a gold chain and a seal attached, it was in my waistcoat pocket hanging in the cabin. The next morning I left my cabin to have a bath, returned in 10 minutes, when the watch, chain, and seal were gone.

I reported the loss to the captain. We arrived in London on November 10, when the watch was shown me by the police.

Police-constable JOHN BREWER, Port of London Police. On November 10, at 9.30 a.m., I saw prisoner leaving the West India. Docks, when I said, ""I am a police officer; have you anything on you that does not belong to you?"" He said, ""No, all I have belongs to me."" I took him to the police station, searched him, and found upon him three watches, including gold watch produced, identified by Mr. Grellier, which was in his left waistcoat pocket. I also found a number of other articles. I asked him, ""How did you get this watch?"" He said, ""I bought it from a passage worker who left the ship at Durban."" I handed prisoner over to the Metropolitan Police.

Detective CHARLES MUNVILL, Port of London Police, corroborated the last witness.

(Defence.)

DANIEL DALY (prisoner, on oath). I was A.B. on board the Inanda When the vessel arrived at the West India Dock I went to work No. 1 winch. I found a coat, which I removed to No. 1 hatch. After tying the ship up I went to the forecastle and then asked the chief officer for money to go ashore. He gave me a sovereign to divide with another man. Passing No. 1 hatch I saw the coat still lying there and picked it up, when there fell from the waistcoat watch produced, a knife, and a pencil case. Thinking the coat belonged to the quarter-master, I took care of them and called out to the other men that I had got the quartermaster's gear, that I was going ashore to change a sovereign and would be back in five minutes. I was stopped at the dock gate by Brewer and searched, when he found upon me two silver watches and a metal one, and asked me how I came by those watches. I said I bought them from a passage worker. I was detained and handed to the Metropolitan Police.

Cross-examined. I have never told anybody this story before. I thought the officer was searching me for contraband goods. I was represented at the police court by a solicitor. I told my solicitor about the quartermaster's coat; he did not suggest that in defence. I told an untruth when I said I had nothing on me which did not belong to me. When I said I had bought it from the passage worker I referred to the silver watches.

Verdict, Guilty.

Prisoner was stated to have joined the Navy in 1901 and in June, 1907, to have been transferred to the Naval Reserve with a good character; he was an excellent seaman and gave satisfaction on the Inanda.

Sentence, 12 months, hard labour."
Breaking Peace,"BABS MILLAR . I live at 81, Tabard Street, Borough; I was formerly a music-hall artiste; I have known prisoner nearly a month. Just after midnight on November 30 I took a gentleman friend home with me; he stayed about 20 minutes. Shortly after he left prisoner knocked at my door and Ilet him in. He commenced urging me (as he had done before) to marry him, and I refused. He said that if I did not he would take care that Harold (a young fellow I had been writing to) should not. I said that Harold had been a good friend to me and that I should not break with him. Prisoner kept arguing and I dozed off to sleep. I woke up with a start and found that prisoner had hold of me, with a razor in his right hand. I got hold of the razor and managed to throw it away. He begged for the razor back again so that he might finish it. Later he tore up some linen and put it round my neck to stanch the bleeding. I remember no more until I woke at 7.30 in the morning, when the postman came and prisoner answered the door. He then sent a woman upstairs (Mrs. Ramswell) to fetch some brandy for me. He said to her, ""Look what I have done to Babs."" She said, ""What have you done it for?"" He said, ""I am sorry now, but she aggravated me."" I was taken to the hospital. I identify the razor produced.

Cross-examined. My injuries were not serious; I did not intend to go to the hospital, nor did I intend to charge prisoner; I had forgiven him soon after he did it. I had been to several public-houses on the day in question. I cannot tell exactly what time it was when prisoner wounded me; it is a lie to suggest that it was done about six in the morning; it was done about half-past one or twenty to two. After the people came in in the morning prisoner did say that he was

going to give himself up, and I said to him, ""Don't leave me; I don't think it is much."" It was a big surprise to me when he was charged at the police court.

Mrs. EMILY RAMSWELL. On the morning of December 1 prisoner called me downstairs and said, ""Don't tell anybody—I have cut her throat."" I saw Millar in bed with her throat bleeding. I asked him, ""What have you done it for?"" He said, ""She made me wild, but I am sorry I done it."" He said he was going to give himself up; I advised him to go for a doctor; he went out and I did not see him again.

Mrs. GARDNER. I went downstairs with last witness (my daughter) and saw prisoner. He said, ""Well, mother, I have been and cut Bab's throat, but I have done it in a hasty temper."" The razor (produced) I found in a bucket in the bedroom.

ALFRED ALEXANDER , son of last witness, said that on the night of November 30, when Millar brought a man home, prisoner told witness that he was ""going to have every farthing in her purse, and cut her throat, and hop off out of it.""

Cross-examined. This was said in the presence of my mother and my eldest brother; mother was deaf and could not hear; my brother is not here. I am now in custody on a charge of theft. I helped the police to find prisoner and arrest him.

Detective-inspector FRANCIS CARLIN, M Division. On December 7 I saw prisoner in Vauxhall. I said, ""I shall arrest you for attempting to murder Babs Millar by cutting her throat with, a razor at 81, Tabard Street on the 1st inst."" He replied, ""Yes, sir; that is quite right."" Later he said, ""She took the razor from me and threw it in a bucket. She wanted me to live on her earnings, but I preferred to work. I was worried before I did it."" When charged he made no reply.

Detective WALTER CRONK, M Division, said that at the police station prisoner said to him, ""How is she going on; is she going on all right? It was a foolish act; I was in a fit of temper.""

Cross-examined. Prisoner has served 12 years in the Army and has a very good character indeed.

REGINALDC. H. FRANCIS , house surgeon at Guy's Hospital. Millar was brought in just before 11 a.m. on December 1. She was in a state of exhaustion and suffering from shock. There was a wound in the throat 3 1/4 inches long, deep enough to cut the edge of the deep muscle, and dividing the external jugular vein. It was a serious wound; it might have been caused by the razor produced; considerable force would be required.

Cross-examined. The wound must have been inflicted at least five or six hours before I saw the woman.

(Defence.)

FREDERICK GUMBRELL (prisoner, on oath). I was in the Royal Garrison Artillery for 12 years; I left on October 21 last, with a good

character; since then I have been working for the Post Office. On November 30 Millar and I were out drinking the whole day. I went to her room about two in the morning; there was some whisky which had been left by the man she had brought in; we both had some. I went to bed in my underclothing and fell off to sleep. I woke between six and seven and started to shave. Millar asked me why I wanted to get up so early and started nagging. I went over to the bed to tell her to shut her mouth and, before I realised what I had done, I saw blood on her throat. I at once tore up some clothing and made a bandage. I told her I would go away and give myself up; she said, ""I don't think it is much."" Before I left the house she knelt up in the bed and asked me to kiss her. I never made to Alexander the statement he has sworn to; he is telling falsehoods.

Cross-examined. Millar had told me that she had brothers in Bedfordshire and that if she could produce her marriage lines the chap who married her would be well set up. I might have said something on this night about not letting Harold or any other man marry her.

Verdict, Guilty of unlawful wounding, with a recommendation to mercy.

Sentence, 12 months' hard labour."
